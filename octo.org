** Some thoughts on Attack of the Friday Monsters      :review:3DS:mechanics:
categories:
- review
- 3DS
- mechanics

It's hard to say anything new about Attack of the Friday Monsters, a
game that splashed on the scene months ago.  The work of its creator
was lovingly lauded by [[https://twitter.com/rdbaaa][Ray Barnholt]]--a noted /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boku_no_Natsuyasumi][Boku no Natsuyami]]/
fanatic--in such a reverent way in his [[http://scroll.vg/issues/10][SCROLL magazine]] that it's
almost sacrilegious to try to write more.  So instead of doing a
point-by-point review, I'll mention some details that stand out to me,
personally.

I played through most of Attack of the Friday Monsters on a flight the
day after I watched Miyazaki's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrietty][Secret World of Arrietty]].  Sure one had
beautiful water colors and amazing visual tricks mimicking real
camerawork and the other used pre-rendered backgrounds with blocky
polygonal actors on the stage, but these art styles complimented one
another.  They didn't clash.

[[http:///images/aotfm.JPG][{% img center /images/aotfm.JPG 320 320 %}]]

I was struck by the ambient sounds that bring the pre-rendered
backgrounds and polygonal characters to life. The periodic train
sounds, presaging the arrival of an in-engine rendered train--sort of
quirky and quaint with today's game engines powerful enough to render
both background and foreground objects--remind me of a previous
exposure to Japanese culture: the first time I watched [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion][Neon Genesis
Evangelion]] as a teenager.  There are the ubiquitous cricket or cicada
sounds that were also present in Eva, but for me, they hearken back to
a youth spent in the rural South.  The drone of cicadas in the sticky
summer heat reminds me of falling asleep in a Mississippi home, of
walking into cool woods after standing in a sunny meadow.

The whole game engine is full of quirks and reminders of the PS1 era
of gaming.  But one of the mechanics seems rather novel, an addition
seemingly for its own sake, with little influence on actual plot or
gameplay.  I'm talking about the spell casting mechanic, reminiscent
of games children used to play in 70s Japan, the time in which Attack
of the Friday Monsters takes place.

If you win the sometimes annoying, somewhat forgettable,
rock-paper-scissors card game, fueled by collectibles strewn
throughout the world, you gain the ability to cast spells on your
buddies, knocking them down.  It has no bearing on the outcome of the
story.  The spell system is simply decoration that deepens the story
by providing a more complete world, accurately capturing what it feels
like to grow up as a child in Japan during the 70s.

You are allowed to pick, and reorder, the phrases of the spell your
character speaks.  This type of cosmetic customization is typical in
modern games, and in Attack of the Friday Monsters it's nothing more
than cosmetic, but it could have been used in surprising ways.

I realized the potential depth of this mechanic during a phone
conversation with my brother. As I told him about the spell casting,
he mentioned a Kickstarted pen and paper RPG called [[http://www.magiciansrpg.com/][Magicians]].
Magicians uses spells spoken in another language as both an impulse
toward learning the language and a mechanic for determining the
success or failure of an action. The game my brother described
involved a Harry Potter-esque international school for magicians in
Korea.

To use magic, the characters, and thus the players, have to correctly
speak Korean words--at least accurately enough to satisfy the
voice-recognition system of an online translation service.  This sets
up the potential for a rather clever scenario in which characters'
/[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]]/ stories are echoed by the players' acquisition of the
language.

At present, on the 3DS, the kind of voice recognition required for
this sort of is [[http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/997781-/58911600][immature]].  But it's certainly possible on more
powerful platforms.

One way to exploit the 3DS, and other devices with touch interfaces,
involves learning written language, such as Japanese /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana][hiragana]]/ or
/[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana][katakana/]].  I can imagine a magic mechanic that involves correctly
writing scrolls, where the fidelity of the player's calligraphic
strokes determines the strength and efficacy of the scrolls.

Another possible approach is to build up language comprehension by
constructing words out of syllables.  Given several options, one would
choose the correct syllable to complete the necessary word, in order
to perform an action or cast a spell.  A similar sort of approach
would work for learning syntax, completing or building a sentence with
the appropriate words.

Attack of the Friday Monsters is a quick experience, but the depth of
its design has made it a memorable one.  If you'd like to learn more
about the game and its creator, you can check out [[http://scroll.vg/extras/summer-vacation-confidential/#a][this interview]] by
Ray Barnholt, which covers Attack of the Friday Monsters and other

[[http://meatfighter.com/][MeatFighter.com]].  The article reverse engineers the inner-workings of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#NES][NES Tetris]].  With great visual aids, the author, [o__1] [1], surveys
the mechanics and data structures used to implement Tetris on the NES.
Then o__1 designs and implements an AI script to play Tetris with
super-human speed and precision.  o__1 even describes how to try it at

I hope to see more articles looking back on classic games with this
tremendous attention to detail.  An older [[http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html][article looking at Pac-man

our appreciation of these games as works of art by documenting the
essential technical complexities underlying these games.  I think
that's a good thing for everyone from hobby developers to professional
developers, as well as designers and fans.

** Bunnies Don't Surf [[http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam][#flappyjam]]

{% img center https://github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf/blob/master/screenshot.png %}

Here's a WIP FlappyBird-like game prototype for [[http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam][#flappyjam]]: [[https://github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf][Bunnies
Don't Surf]].  You are an unfortunate rabbit whose warren is being
flooded by a passing thunderstorm.  You have to navigate the
tunnels of the warren, propelled by the wave of water flooding
your home.  There's only one problem: Bunnies Don't Surf.  So you're
stuck hopping up and down in a futile attempt to survive.

Bunnies Don't Surf requires [[http://www.python.org/][Python]] and [[http://pygame.org/news.html][pygame]] ([[http://pygame.org/download.shtml][version 1.9.1]]) to play.

Tap =space= to hop. That's about all there is to say about the
controls.

As I'm sure you can see, the game is in dire need of art assets, sound
assets, and some sort of high score system.  I'll do my best to add
these, once time allows. If anyone has feedback or art design ideas,
please let me know in the comments section or on Twitter.  I'd love to
hear it.

I'll post updates as the game progresses, and officially submit it to
#flappyjam  if it's done before the jam ends on February 24.

** What's in a name?
Growing up, the seemingly interminable school-week gave way to an
anxious car drive home from the rental store with the weekend's score.
You remember those, right?

Usually the rental would include the instruction manual.  On the ride
home, I'd pour over the manual, trying to glean useful information to
supplement my Nintendo Power-fueled strategies to maximize my fun in
the limited time I had with the game.  Often I'd get so engrossed with
the manual, learning the universe for the game, I'd let my brother or
a friend play the game first.

The looming question, not covered in the manual, was always: When will
my turn end?  When will my brother run out of lives, so I can get a
turn?

We developed a vocabulary to deal with the count down to game over. On
your first play-through it was unclear whether the last life was when
your stock counter read 1 or 0.  If you had one life left, you could
play extra hard, using a rush of adrenaline to try to stay alive
longer.

Sometimes, it was game over when the stock counter ticked over from 1
to 0.  In other games, when the stock counter reads 0, zero is a life.

The name of this blog comes from that reassuring sense that you have
an extra chance.  "Don't worry, zero's a life."

** Setting up Emacs-like key bindings in MonoDevelop
Categories:
- tools

I'm playing around with Unity to try to learn how it works.  Shout out
to Infinite Ammo for the excellent video tutorials. Since I don't know
much about Unity, I'm reluctantly using their included MonoDevelop
IDE.  While I heard that Emacs-like key bindings were included, in the
build I installed they weren't present.

MonoDevelop does not make it easy to import new key binding schemes
(the blog post linked here suggests submitting a bug report to suggest
new key bindings...).  So, I did a little digging around on github and
found the [[https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/master/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/options/KeyBindingSchemeEmacs.xml][default emacs key binding scheme]] that I imagine should have
been included in the MonoDevelop build I installed.

There was no way to add this key binding scheme to my available key
bindings in MonoDevelop, so I hacked my Custom key binding file
located at =~/Library/MonoDevelop-Unity-4.0/KeyBindings/Custom.mac-kb.xml=.

I started with some simple copypasta.  But then I found some useful
navigation features were lacking.  So, I added key binds that
immediately came to mind, like =Alt-f= for moving forward one word and
=Alt-b= for backward word.  Yes, I know these are =M-f= in Emacs, but
I'm using MonoDevelop's syntax here.

My key bindings are available in the gist below.  I'll update this
gist when I add key bindings, to keep a current working version
available.

** Cut it all right in two: bisect to find bugs
- algorithm
- tools

Imagine there's a lion in a desert.  You need to cage the lion or you
will be eaten.  In this example the desert is your code and the lion
is a bug that you're having a hard time pinning down.

There are many ways to trap a lion.  Here's one.

Build a fence dividing the desert in half going North to South.
Assuming the lion is not in the South section, divide the North
section in half with a fence going East to West.  Repeat the process
until your fence is arbitrarily small and has become a cage trapping
the lion.

But how does this relate to code?

Say you have a relatively large file that executes fine, but
introduces a bug into your larger system.  You suspect that something
has gone wrong with the large file, but you're not getting an error
implicating a specific line.

Cut it all right in two.

Comment out half the code in your large file and try to reproduce the
bug.  If you reproduce the bug, repeat the process as necessary until
you isolate the line producing the problem.

I learned about this approach for bugsleuthing from the [[https://gist.github.com/stardiviner/8109774#file-temp-txt-L26][bot in #emacs
on freenode]].  It's particularly useful for tracking down bugs in large
configuration files.  There's a list of humorous lion-trapping
algorithm examples [[http://faculty.smu.edu/yzhou/humor/lion.htm][here]].
** Upgrading to Mavericks

- OS X

This week I upgraded to [[https://www.apple.com/osx/][Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks]].  To keep [[http://octopress.org/][octopress]]
working, I had to uninstall and reinstall [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/][Ruby]].

Upon trying a =rake generate= task, I saw errors in the Ruby gems for
processing [[http://www.yaml.org/][YAML]].  I assume this is due to the fact that I built them
on the older OS X install.

Interestingly, [[https://rvm.io/][RVM]] survived the upgrade and seems to be working just
fine.

I followed the instructions [[https://gist.github.com/imathis/1104557][here]] to uninstall and reinstall Ruby, the
bundler, and all bundled gems for my octopress install.  The
instructions mention a specific problem for OS X Lion, but these steps
solved the problem for me.

** The Fate of Adventure Games

Zoyə Street wrote a [[https://medium.com/p/3e3c1e20cfd0][summary]] of an interesting [[http://www.omnsh.org/ressources/527/histoire-formelle-du-jeu-daventure-sur-ordinateur-le-cas-de-lamerique-du-nord-de-1976][PhD thesis by Jonathan
Lessard]].  Lessard examines the history of adventure games, to see
whence they've come and where they've gone.  Like Street, I think this
approach to thinking about video game design and genre provides useful
perspective.

Lessard concludes that the adventure game genre didn't vanish, it
sublimated into, and was subsumed by, other modern multi-genre
games.

For example, consider 3d RPGs incorporating first-person shooter
perspective and playstyle.  I could be describing Skyrim or Titanfall,
two dramatically different games.

Lessard and Street argue, convincingly, that these sorts of games have
all the hallmarks of adventure games, while evolving new forms and
structures of play.

And now for something completely different: a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators][markov chain text
generation]] twitter bot.  Styx_ebooks tweets random text generated from
a corpus of Bangsian fantasy novels.  Its name comes from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrick_Bangs][John
Kendrick Bangs]]' novel /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House-Boat_on_the_Styx][A House-boat on the Styx]]/ and the general
[[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks][twitter ebooks meme]].

I forked it from an earlier project by [[https://github.com/jiko][@jiko]], [[https://github.com/jiko/lovecraft_ebooks][lovecraft_ebooks]].  There
were some minor implementation hurdles, mainly related to Twitter's
API and oauth.  Reading the [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter][python =twitter= package]] =twitter.oauth=
docstring set me straight.  You can check out the code in [[https://github.com/zerosalife/styx_ebooks][my fork on
github]].

This sort of text generation algorithm isn't just useful for making
annoying twitter bots.  You could alter some of the in-game text or
dialog based on a corpus fed into a markov chain text generator.
Especially in the case of a Lovecraftian horror game, I can see how
this text could serve a thematic purpose in the story.

Say you've got a Lovecraftian horror game in which the player is an
investigator who is trying to figure out what is happening to citizens
of Innsmouth.  By interacting with NPCs, the player encounters hand
written dialog, with occasional markov-generated gibberish thrown in.
The amount of gibberish depends on how corrupted the individual
denizens of Innsmouth are becoming.  If the player is not clever
enough to determine who is corrupt, the player will be killed.  If the
player determines the source of the corruption, the player wins.

Along the same line of reasoning, the concept I'm describing here
mimics the game [[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905][ALZ]], a touching short, playable in 2 or 3 minutes,
which uses glitchy graphics to convey a sense of what it's like to
live with Alzheimer's disease to the player.  I came across Dylan
Carter's ALZ in a [[http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/making-alz-glitch-fueled-game-alzheimers/][post on the ANIMAL blog]].  This approach of literally
altering the player's experience of the game world to mimic the
subjective experience of characters in the game is ripe for
exploration.  I'd love to hear about more examples.

** Clojure Rhizome Labeled Edge Tutorial
- algorithm
- tutorial
- design
- tools
- Clojure

I'm using the [[https://github.com/ztellman/rhizome][Rhizome package]] for Clojure to rapidly prototype the
dependency graph for a crafting system.  It's nice to be able to add
and remove components while generating visualizations on-the-fly.
Clojure's simple, composable syntax, aided by paredit, makes shuffling
around key-value pairs, and even whole dictionaries, quick and easy.

The existing Rhizome documentation shows simple examples for labeling
the nodes of a directed graph.  In order to show the relationship
between nodes on the graph, I'd like to also label the edges, or the
arrows connecting the nodes.

Rhizome provides a keyword argument =:edge->descriptor= to most of its
functions.  Consulting the source code and the tests for the Rhizome
package, I learned that the functions expect =:edge->descriptor= to be
a function accepting two arguments for each edge: =src=, the source
node, and =dst=, the destination node.  In order to label the edges,
the anonymous function I'm binding to =:edge->descriptor= will return
a dictionary containing the key =:label= and the value for the edge's
label.

Here's an example using the simple graph from the Rhizome
documentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (use 'rhizome.viz)

  (def g
      {:a [:b :c]
       :b [:c]
       :c [:a]})

  (view-graph (keys g) g
              :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label n}))

#+END_SRC

{% img graph-unlabeled-edges.png %}

Now, I'll use a dictionary of dictionaries to associate the source and
destination nodes with a label for each edge.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def g-edges
    {:a {:b :makes
         :c :takes}
     :b {:c :takes}
     :c {:a :makes}})

  (view-graph (keys g) g
              :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label n})
              :edge->descriptor (fn [src dst] {:label (dst (src g-edges))}))

#+END_SRC

{% img graph-labeled-edges.png %}

I've submitted a [[https://github.com/ztellman/rhizome/pull/8][pull request]] to Rhizome to add this example to the
documentation.

** Why are caves central to so many games?
My 2¢ in response to @psysal's question: Why are caves central to so
many games?
- design


On twitter, [[https://twitter.com/psysal][@psysal]] posed this question to the game dev community:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/psysal/statuses/456314611428372480 %}

You can see all the responses by following the link to the original
tweet.

The consensus is that caves are essential features for games for three
reasons.

1) Linearity
2) Repeatability of composition
3) Curiosity

<!--more-->

*** Caves are linear

In terms of their schematic representation in the design of a game,
caves can boil down to one enclosed 'area' or room with a single
entrance.  This doesn't account for some of the amazing environments
in intricately designed games like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid][Super Metroid]], recently broken down
by [[https://twitter.com/gamespite][@gamespite]] in [[http://www.anatomyofgames.com/2013/12/08/the-anatomy-of-super-metroid-01-moving-pictures/][the Anatomy of Games series]].

But, at the most basic level, a cave must have a mouth, or an
entrance, and at least one room.  This simplifies the representation
of the critical path of play, because once the cave has been fully
explored there are no possible branches that the player could have
taken to leave the cave.  The single entrance is also a single exit.
Even if there are many internal rooms, this representation holds true,
as long as there are ultimately no 'back doors' out of the cave.

The designer can rely on the fact that once the player has received
any rewards for exploring the cave, the player can reasonably be
expected to pop out of the entrance of the cave looking for the next
available challenge surmountable with any freshly acquired toys.

*** Caves offer repeatable composition

For whatever atavistic significance they hold in our psyches, caves do
not have to rely on realistic representations in game design.  Any old
hole in some rock will almost invariably create a believable sense of
cave-ness.  Yeah, I said cave-ness. You know cave-ocity, general
cave-itude.

Since we don't spend much time in caves, day-to-day, we don't hold
them to the same level of fidelity to which we would hold, say,
buildings or automobiles.  The same architectural details necessary to
represent a house in a video game can be painted in broad strokes to
represent a cave.

In tile-based games, this means that a designer can reuse tiles over
and over again to craft a general shape without worrying too much
about players noticing, or being bothered by, the similarities.  Caves
are thus more defined by the space created rather than the graphics
used to define them.  This sense of space is what drives the third
essential feature of caves in game design, a sense of curiosity, the
drive to explore.

*** Caves are inherently curious

I'm not sure I buy the argument that we have some evolutionary
instinct that drives us to explore caves, but the fact remains.
Something about caves begs exploration.

Call it the /Will to Spelunk/.

Once a space has been created, the player wants to explore every nook
and cranny for collectible power ups or items.  Certainly the rewards
are powerful motivators.  But there is something to the exploration
for exploration's sake.  Simply completing one's mental map of the
space becomes a goal in itself.

*** Coda

It's intriguing that caves are such a fixture in the established
vocabulary of game design.  The three features highlighted in this
post make it clear that caves remain a useful game design pattern
because they serve an essential purpose in the ludic lexicon of games.

** Follow-up to the centrality of caves
- design


My [[/blog/2014/05/03/why-are-caves-central-to-so-many-games/][post last week]] about caves struck a nerve.  I received a lot of
encouraging retweets and favorites.  I also received some great
feedback.

Paul Diaz points out one design constraint granted by caves that I
hadn't considered.

{% tweet https://twitter.com/sleepytearyeyed/status/462624220447391744 %}

I think Paul is right, that this falls within the scope of caves'
linearity.  I've been thinking a bit about a possible taxonomy of cave
environments in games, but for the purposes of these posts I'll keep
it more general.  A cave is a cave, right?  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it][We know it when we see
it.]]

Any old screen in a game can be cave-like in the way its environmental
design constraints fit into the game world.  Here I'm using 'screen'
to refer to a room in a metroid-like game or a level in other sorts of
games--some arbitrary atomic unit of division of the game environment
constituting a discrete area.

For the purpose of argument, Paul's point forces us to think of the
most cave-y of caves, which I think was the intent behind the original
question in the first place.  Because caves are dark environments,
dank environments, /interior/ environments, they lack the uniform
lighting that typically characterizes the exterior 'overworld' in
games.  As Paul states, lighting cues can serve as guideposts for the
player, directing attention toward the critical path.

I view this example as a manifestation of the fundamental reduction in
degrees of freedom of play achieved by the interiority, and thus,
linearity of caves.  The fact that there are more walls, and therefore
fewer possible places for the player to go, allows for the designer,
using careful construction, to communicate intent to the player
through the environment itself.  I don't mean to say here that such
communication is impossible outside of caves, just that caves are one
simple and straightforward way to achieve this constrained,
communicative sort of design.  This vocabulary of design showed up
early on in the history of games, it worked, and it has persisted.

** Quarries of Scred Roadmap
[[http://www.indiedb.com/games/quarries-of-scred/news/quarries-of-scred-rolling-down-the-roadmap]]

The [[http://darkestkale.itch.io/quarries-of-scred][Quarries of Scred]] [[https://twitter.com/darkestkale][developer]] released an image showing the overview
of Scred's 14-day game development.  I find it informative for a
couple of reasons.  First it's not limited to the core features of the
game, Kale's also included public relations and marketing information.
Second, the fact that it's incomplete shows how Kale's prioritized
critical elements of the game.

Rather than blatantly stealing the [[http://www.indiedb.com/games/quarries-of-scred/images/quarries-of-scred-roadmap-2013-11-28-01][roadmap for Quarries of Scred]], I'll
give you a few seconds to go and capture an eidetic mental image.  Got
it?  Great.  I guess all you cheaters who opened it another tab can
follow along too.

<!--more-->

*** Core Gameplay
Looking at the presumably completed 'green light' items, Core Gameplay
is almost finished.  And it should be.  Without Core Gameplay, there's
not much game to be played.

It looks like they have not included actual aspects of the core
mechanic implementation on this roadmap.  However, they're using the
roadmap as a method of cataloging oft-overlooked features that add
polish to the final game.

They have a milestone for implementing a persistent high score system.
This hurdle is easy to imagine, since we see it in almost every game
we play.  But it can be tricky to implement in a robust and efficient
manner.

Several elements of UI are included on the roadmap.  They could be
neglected in a prototype, these UI elements can make a finished game
welcoming for new players and compelling enough to replay.  Info
screens can clarify the world for tyros and explicitly show unique
challenge states to experienced players.  Death information, like
gravestones in Nethack, provides potentially entertaining feedback for
the players attempting to hone their skills at the game.

I'm not sure whether they finished implementing rocket ship building
gameplay in Quarries of Scred, but this should be a goal for every
game.

*** PR
Marketing is an aspect of game development that is easy to overlook as
an inexperienced indie or hobby gamedev with a few gamejams under your
belt.  The pressure to simply finish a game, any shippable game,
overshadows what to do with it once it's released.

Setting up an IndieDB page to track the progress is a great idea.
And, since it doesn't necessarily require a finished product, it can
be done early on in the development process.  The priorities of
creating an IndieDB Icon, Header Image, and Preview Image show Kale's
clearly interested in branding Scred as a marketable indie title.

I can confirm that a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBrZ_POiKJO4][Trailer]], [[http://darkestkale.itch.io/quarries-of-scred][Website]], and [[http://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvODc0LzQ0MTIucG5n/original/Npan5L.png][Box Art]] came along in due
time.  The inclusion of Box Art in a download only indie title is
particularly charming, even in an atmosphere awash with these things,
the art for Scred's box is fun and quaint, in a good way.

*** Further Content
Further Content looks like features that would directly build on those
already implemented in the game.  Rather than being classified as
Fluff, these extra features would complement the content and features
already implemented in the game.

It's important to have the courage to 'kill your darlings' in cases
like this.  Some of the items under Fluff like pretty important to
making a good game, but if they are too demanding to fit in the
schedule allotted to create the game, they have to go.

One of the buildings has made it in.  And I think the second building
is in the final game. Not sure whether the Rare Flower survived.

*** Bookending
The Bookending category looks like a lot of the UI improvements I
talked about above.  They certainly improve players' experience, but
they may not be absolutely necessary to get the game out the door.

I can only speculate that configurable keys are highlighted in gray
because it would be silly not to include them.  For that matter,
everything except troubleshooting info adds delicious spice to the
well-seasoned dish that the Core Gameplay milestones create.

*** Fluff
It looks like the Fluff category represents additional features that
aren't required to make a working game.  The ability to select a seed
is probably a new system that requires designing and implementing,
much like the UI stuff in the Bookending category.  New Sprites and
Death Animation are probably a similar story.

You may argue that music and sound are critical for a completed game.
But if you are not a musically inclined person, the shear amount of
work required to get something that sounds like the death-throes of a
thousand Gameboys (note: this is not a good thing) could double your
production time.  The New Sprites mentioned in the previous paragraph
are probably a similar case of requiring too much time that could be
more productively devoted elsewhere in the project.

*** Closing Thoughts
This kind of frank openness about game design is unusual to get prior
to the publication of a game.  It's really great to see the design
documents behind a game, even if it comes out years after release.
It's especially informative to see an in-progress version where the
developer is unafraid to lay the goals out there, to show where the
project succeeds and possibly falls short.

** Hammock driven creativity
- design
- algorithm
- tools

In 2010, [[https://twitter.com/richhickey][Rich Hickey]] spoke at Clojure Conj about [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Df84n5oFoZBc]['Hammock Driven
Development']].  Hickey was talking about the benefit of down-time for
noodling about software design.  Specifically, Hickey means using
down-time after considerably 'loading up' your mind with aspects of
the problem, in order to leverage background offline processes to
solve those difficult problems.

Hickey's advice is to wait for it.  Wait overnight.  Get good rest and
make sure that you are sleeping well.  Then you will be able to think
about the clearly on the next day.  If you are lucky perhaps you will
receive inspiration from a dream and wake up with the problem solved.
This sort of inspiration is what Hickey means by leveraging background
processing.

Hickey mentions working on more than one project.  By having multiple
projects, you avoid the problems of creative block, or writer's block.
You can be productive simply by working on another project.  One
drawback is that frantically flitting from project to project can lead
to problems finishing any single project.  I am often guilty of this.

I plan on writing about properly scoping projects to make it possible
to get them to a finished state later.  One method that works for me
is getting something to the point that I can write a blog post about
it.  Even if it's not 'finished' finished, I get some satisfaction
with putting it out there in a relatively thought out and complete
form.

My solution is to *record, record, record*.  I keep lots of notes,
both in more structured form on this blog and in more sketchy form in
files on my computer.  I also draw out visual design ideas in a
notebook.  Sometimes I will set up skeleton game projects simply to
test out an idea.  If I have some sudden insight into a problem, then
all of these ideas are available later.

Hickey says to avoid being stuck, switch.  That is why having multiple
projects can help.  Hickey also mentions a great suggestion of talking
about design hiccups and problems with other people.  Tweet about your
design roadblocks.  Write a blog post about them.  Telepathically
communicate about them before you go to sleep, so magical dream elves
can come and solve them for you.

Unless you are Rich Hickey or--I dunno--Gary Gygax, simply thinking
about a problem /a priori/ will not result in a great game.  There is
still something to be said for getting your hands dirty and iterating
on a design.  However the techniques highlighted in Hickey's talk can
be useful when you are stuck on a design problem.

Hit me up in the comments or on the [[https://twitter.com/zerosalife][tweet tweet]] if you have any great
Hammock Driven Design tips that I haven't covered here.

** Why you should start simple
My thoughts about a long-read from @hobbygamedev on why you should
start simple.

- design
- mechanics

[[http://twitter.com/hobbygamedev][@HobbyGameDev's]] long-read [[http://www.hobbygamedev.com/beg/incremental-learning/]["Reasons for Modest First Projects and
Incremental Learning"]] tells the tragic tale of overambitious novice
developers.

In a response to a doubting tweeter, HGD advocates starting modestly
to slowly build skills, so that you can tackle more complicated
projects later on.  Avoiding overambitious projects that are way
outside of your comfort zone is one of the stumbling points for novice
and hobby game developers, like myself.

In the [[{%25%20post_url%202014-05-031-hammock-driven-creativity%20%25}][previous post about Hammock Driven Creativity]], I highlighted
Rich Hickey's suggestion to keep multiple projects going in order to
avoid stagnation.  While I agree with this, it's important to judge
the scope of those projects with a critical eye.

Far too often, my ideas start, at least in my mind, with ambitious
artwork, animation, and multiple complex combinations of mechanics.  I
am neither talented nor skilled enough to pull these projects off.  So
it's easy to get stuck.

I often find myself implementing some ad-hoc animation system,
spending time reinventing the frame-based or skeletal wheel, as it
were.  Animation shouldn't take priority, especially considering that
my best artwork is derivative and possibly one step above programmer
art.  I should focus on creating compelling prototypes, and worry
about polish later.

To build your skillset, HGD suggests starting out by remaking
historical games.  By implementing tried-and-true mechanics that are
necessarily simple in scope given their ancient hardware, you can
confront the problems involved in creating a full game rather than a
half-finished proof-of-concept.

By half-finished, I'm thinking of a time where I completely abandoned
a concept because I was hung-up on optimizing a tile-based room
system.  Rather than making the actual gameplay fun and complete, I
was focusing all of my time figuring out how to make walls.  Walls are
nice in a finished game, and you could make the case that they are
required constraints to achieve good gameplay, but they are not where
the fun is.  As HGD and my previous post point out, you can keep
trying to work on these overly ambitious projects, but your
productivity will suffer.

Best to reap the rewards that come from continued productivity and, as
HGD says, pick a fight you can win.



** Playable Call For Papers
My thoughts on the playful "needlessly interactive" CFP from @mtrc.

- design

[[http://www.twitter.com/mtrc][Michael Cook]] made a "needlessly interactive" [[http://www.exag.org/playablecfp/][playable call for papers]]
for the [[http://www.exag.org/][Experimental AI in Games conference]], taking place in October
in Raleigh, NC.  It's a minimally expressive Twine story, with really
one simple interactive experience of role-playing the interaction a
recipient feels upon receiving yet another CFP email, /click/.

It's a tricky thing to get right.  While it makes sense for a
game-related conference to have a text adventure announcement, I don't
want to have to play a game of Frogger to purchase movie tickets from
the automated kiosk at the movie theater.  It would be nice if the
playable CFP included prominent and consistent links to exit the game,
in order to read the ordinary CFP on the conference website.

I believe the motivating idea is sound.  Turning banal daily routine
into a playful interactive experience is a worthy goal for game
design.  It has the ability to startle the player into paying more
attention to mundane activities, which I think is the intended goal,
for a CFP to stand out from piles of other CFP emails.

Let me know if you've come across games in strange places.  I don't
mean finding a boxed copy of Mario Kart at the flea market--I mean
conceptually strange places.  Hit me up on twitter if you've got ideas
like this to discuss, because I think this approach of creating small
play experiences to "gamify" mundane tasks is an emerging theme of
design.


** The Strength of the Pitch: Jodorowsky's Dune
- design
- collaboration


I was fortunate enough to catch a screening of /[[http://jodorowskysdune.com/][Jodorowsky's Dune]]/,
the documentary about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky][visionary director Alejandro Jodorowsky's]] failed
attempt to adapt the science fiction novel /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)][Dune]]/ to the silver screen.
Having seen a similar [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308514/][documentary about Terry Gilliam's attempt at
adapting Don Quixote]], I consider myself a fan of the genre, despite
its niche appeal.

One quick note before we go on.  It looks like /Jodorowsky's Dune/ has
hit Netflix on DVD, and seems a likely candidate to be available for
streaming.  So you can check it out for yourself to see if you agree
with my take.

<!--more-->

*** Pitching
Jodorowsky looks back, with good-natured humor, on a massively
overambitious project for its time.  Aside from the amazing concept
art and avant-garde stylings, I took away two messages from the
documentary that I would like to share.  The first deals with the art
of pitching your ideas and the second with locating oneself in close
to proximity to the best and the brightest potential collaborators.

Jodorowsky set out to create a huge book--more of a cinder block.
It's probably what we could call a design bible today, which would be
delivered to production companies in order to secure funding.  By
creating a book of storyboards and character designs, Jodorowsky
wanted to show that the project was large in scope but feasible,
because it had been so intricately planned.

Jodorowsky reached out to a variety of concept artists to help with
the design of the movie.  To visual and technical artists, Jodorowsky
made impassioned pitches, claiming that they would become "spiritual
warriors" for their collective vision, and implored them to come live
and work (for little or no pay) in Paris.

What stands out is the strength of Jodorowsky's pitch.  At a time when
artists like [[http://www.chrisfossart.com/][Chris Foss]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud][Moebius]], and [[http://www.hrgiger.com/][H.R. Giger]] were each becoming
established in their own rights, Jodorowsky was able, through the
sheer strength of an imagined story, to convince them to devote years
of effort to the project.  That takes a lot of gumption.  It didn't
hurt that Jodorowsky had a strong track record of visually and
thematically impressive avant-garde cinema.  Even still, Jodorowsky is
great at selling the idea, and that is something that game designers
must do, to communicate ideas to others in order to capitalize on the
individual talents and assemble a great team.

*** Placement
The second message I took away deals with putting yourself into the
right place at the right time.  It's also about leveraging that
placement to connect and collaborate.

The documentary showed a curious problem of the movie's mid-Seventies
inception.  How do you find people to collaborate with, or even people
at all, before the Internet?

The solution: go to Paris.  That's where all the intelligentsia
congregate.  This was more or less true for several hundred years
before the Internet.

If you want [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%25C3%25AD][Salvador Dali]] in your movie, playing the [[http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Padishah_Emperor][Emperor of the
Known Universe]], go to Paris and you'll probably run into Dali.

Now we all live in our decentralized [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone][temporary autonomous zones]].  But
for as much as they can fragment, social media have the ability to
connect disparate artists and thinkers.

I think that Twitter is a platform that serves as a modern Paris, for
like-minded people to seek each other out and communicate.  Go
congregate with the intelligentsia and let your ideas speak for
themselves.  Hit me up on the proverbial tweets, and let me hear your
ideas and pitches.  I'm constantly working on mine--writing here,
trying to refine my skills.  Maybe we are both looking for the talents
that we can provide.


** Space Is Read
Space Is Red, a #spacecowboygamejam entry by @todluk made me think
about interactivity in visual novels as a genre and media at large.

- game
- review
- mechanics
- design

[[http://tdlk.itch.io/space-is-red][Space Is Red]] is not so much a game as it is a visual novel.  Out of
the games I tried from the [[http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam][#spacecowboygamejam]], it's one that sticks
with me.

On the spectrum of play, these sorts of games are loosely analogous to
Choose Your Own Adventure books.  Just as a Choose Your Own Adventure
book expects the player to turn to a given page according to the rules
laid out at the bottom of the pages to proceed in a consistent,
logical fashion, the tropes of a visual novel require the player to
interact with the game in order for the story to proceed.  A novel
will proceed with the only 'player' interaction consisting of turning
to the next page.  I'm oversimplifying the difference between /real
choices/, as I would argue, Choose Your Own Adventure Books allow, and
/mere interactivity/, like turning the page of a novel, but you get
what I mean.

Visual novels can have real choices and interactivity.  In this case,
I'd argue that Space Is Red is only interactive.  There are no real
choices, short of figuring out the next bit to tap on in order to move
the story along.  For me, it's the music that makes the experience gel
as something more than an animated e-book.

I don't mean to be presumptuous in my analysis of Space Is Red's
gameplay, don't get me wrong.  I'm not interested in arguments about
merit simply based on A *is* a game but B *isn't*, so A is better.  I
just think it's important to think about these sorts of things when
considering the underlying design.

I left the game looping [[https://soundcloud.com/postpre][PostPre's]] driving soundtrack for 15 minutes,
even though my first play-through lasted only 2 or 3.  Maybe that's
the benefit of interactivity and choices, to extend and prolong the
mindshare of some experience or product with the player.  I don't
necessarily mean that in a cynical way, although the typical model of
play can be subverted for more manipulative means (and, of course, it
is!).

For me, Space Is Red hit all the right notes and left me with
something to think about.  That is what I call a successful gamejam
game.  You can see Space Is Red and the other #spacecowboygamejam
entries [[http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam][here]].  If you're interested in learning more about Space Is
Red's creator [[http://toddluke.com/][Todd Luke]], you can find an interview [[http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TalhaKaya/20140711/220825/Finding_Beauty_in_Imperfection_Interview_with_Todd_Luke.php][here]].

** Static and Dynamic Colliders in Unity
Summarizing what I've learned about Colliders in Unity based on a
tutorial by @clapollo.

- Unity
- mechanics

According to the [[http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes][Ray Wenderlich Unity 2D tutorial]] by [[http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/clapollo][Christopher
LaPollo]], Unity's physics engine builds a simulation based on the
[[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html][Colliders]] present in a scene.  If some those =Colliders= are declared
to be =static=, then the entire simulation is rebuilt when those
colliders move.  Of course, rebuilding a physics simulation when it's
unnecessary is inefficient.  By declaring objects to have =dynamic=
=Colliders=, the physics engine does not have to rebuild the
simulation at runtime, that is to say when the game is running.

As with a lot of things in Unity, it is not immediately apparent how
you should go about declaring a collider to be =static= or =dynamic=.
It would be great if there were just a checkbox in the =Collider=
component.  But there isn't.  It appears that there are some complex
things going on under the hood that preclude a simple declaration.

By default a =GameObject= with a =Collider= component attached is
treated as =static= by Unity's physics engine.  This would work for a
non-moving wall or impassable bit of scenery, but for moving objects
like enemies we need to mark them as =dynamic=.  In order for a
=GameObject='s =Collider= to qualify as =dynamic= it requires a
[[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html][=Rigidbody= component]].  If you don't want the normal features of the
=Rigidbody=, i.e. conferring control of the =GameObject='s position to
the physics system, then you can check the =Is Kinematic= checkbox.  A
kinematic object's position is under the control of the attached
scripts, rather than the physics system.

One other trick from the [[http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes][tutorial]] is to set the =Collider= component's
=isTrigger= property to =true=.  This prevents the =Collider= from
being treated as a solid object in the physics simulation, which could
lead to unintended bumping and pushing among various =Colliders= in a
scene.

** Persistent Data in Unity
I'm interested in having some data remain available, even though I'm
switching Scenes in Unity.

- Unity3d
- design
- C#

I'm interested in having some data remain available, even though I'm
switching Scenes in Unity.  In other words, I want this data to remain
persistent.  As you'll see below I was tempted to use =PlayerPrefs= to
store the data, but, according to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJ6FfcJpbPXE][this Unity Live Training on Data
Persistence]], =PlayerPrefs= is not the best way to make data persist
over multiple Scenes.  =PlayerPrefs= is an okay place to store
non-critical data, like the audio volume, window size, full-screen
state--you know preferences.  I'll go ahead and show what I believe to
be the correct way to store persistent data before talking about
=PlayerPrefs= later.

*** Persistent data
To safely and reliably store persistent data, the Unity tutorials
suggest that you need to assign a "kinda" Singleton design patterny
script to an empty =GameObject= that will persist across Scenes.

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  using UnityEngine;
  using System.Collections;

  public class GameControl: MonoBehaviour {
    public static GameControl control;

    public float health;
    public float experience;

    void Awake() {
      if(control == null){
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        control = this;
      } else if(control != this) {
        // There can be only one!
        Destroy(gameObject);
      }
    }
  }

#+END_SRC

The =static= reference means that we can just access the values in the
=GameControl= script.

*** How to access data in the GameController.
#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  GameController.control.health = 100;

#+END_SRC

*** Writing persistent data to a binary file
The persistent data that's under the control of the =GameController=
is perfectly happy hanging out when your application is running.  It
will persist between Scenes when other data is wiped out by Unity's
garbage collection.  But what if you want to maintain persistent data
when the application is closed.

Ah hah!  Finally, an answer to my nagging question about writing
persistent data to plain text files, like =PlayerPrefs= or simply a
file in a local directory.  Wouldn't a player be able to modify the
data?

Enter the binary format:

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  // Add two more libraries
  using System;
  using System.Runtime.Serialzation.Formatters.Binary;

#+END_SRC

Where do we save it?  The persistent data path:
=Application.persistentDataPath=.  We'll need one more library to do
some input and output to files:

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  // Requires one more library and we're ready to get cooking with some
  // methods
  using System.IO;

  public void Save() {
    BinaryFormatter bf = new BinaryFormatter();
    FileStream file = File.Open(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat",
                                FileMode.Open);

    PlayerData data = new PlayerData();
    data.experiencePoints = experiencePoints;
    data.playerLevel = playerLevel;

    bf.Serialize(file, data);
    file.Close();
  }

  public void Load() {
    if(File.Exists(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat")) {
      BinaryFormatter bf = new BinaryFormatter();
      FileStream file = File.Open(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat",
                                  FileMode.Open);
      PlayerData data = (PlayerData)bf.Deserialize(file);
      file.Close();

      experiencePoints = data.experiencePoints;
      playerLevel = data.playerLevel;
    }
  }

#+END_SRC

Now we need to make the =PlayerData= class that we will tag with
=[Serializable]= so Unity will know that we want to write this to a
binary file at some point in the future.  This affects how Unity
stores the data internally, but it doesn't really change how we
interact with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  [Serializable]
  class PlayerData {
    // TODO: see about making gets and sets.
    // TODO: automate the generation of this data structure.  See:
    // http://forums.devx.com/showthread.php?170650-How-to-dynamically-add-property-to

    // Add new variables for loading and saving here.
    public int experiencePoints;
    public int playerLevel;
  }

#+END_SRC

After writing up this article, I came across an older, possibly better
article on Unity Gems.  Please check out that write-up and all of the
great content on the site.  [[http://unitygems.com/saving-data-1-remember-me/]]

My full =GameController= data persistence Singleton script is
available in [[https://gist.github.com/zerosalife/6f6e811b27761d287ea5][this gist]].

So, that's the best solution I've found to date for having persistent
data across scenes and play sessions.  I've included my rough first
stabs at the problem below.  Keep in mind that anything following this
point is just included just to make my notes available, and it's not
meant to be a guide.

*** Old notes: PlayerPrefs
In order to have persistent data between Scenes, I was previously
going to make use of Unity's =PlayerPrefs=, a class that implements
persistent data storage for =ints=, =floats=, and =strings=.  Notably
absent are useful data types like =Vector3= to maintain, for example,
=transform= data between Scenes.  Some of the solutions I found may
still be helpful for more storing complex data types in =PlayerPrefs=.

One potential solution is to simply set a =GameObject='s
=transform.position= to some constant =Vector3= value in the freshly
loaded Scene.  While this is possible in some applications, I'm going
to assume that eventually you'll want to transfer some dynamic
position information between Scenes.

Here are two potentially helpful sources to achieve this:

[[http://www.theappguruz.com/tutorial/store-vector3-data-easily-using-json-parsing-possible-using-playerprefs/]],
based on work by Mehta Dakshil.   While JSON parsing looks
interesting, it requires an external =.dll=, =JsonFx.Json.dll=.  And
I'm not interested in external dependencies here.  It may work great
for you.

[[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DArrayPrefs][http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=ArrayPrefs]], based on work by
Mario Madureiera Fontes and Daniel P. Rossi.  (Note: since
=GetVector3= depends on =GetFloatArray=, there could be some error due

** One Tap Quest: a pachinko RPG
A review of One Tap Quest, a game by @shimage_net

[[http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/]]

I recently played /[[http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/][One Tap Quest]]/, a game in which you tap to place an
RPG character who marches upward, gaining levels by bumping into
enemies, to tackle bigger and badder foes.  What's interesting to me,
if you'll bear with me, is that this is a game that amounts to a
pachinko RPG.  I'll start by talking about what I liked about /One Tap
Quest/.  [[http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg/][Next week]], I'll get into what I mean by a pachinko RPG.

It's rare that I come to a new gameplay experience completely naive
these days. The only way I feel I can effectively spend my time with a
game is typically after having read some sort of guide because my time
is extremely limited.

What the /One Tap Quest/ accomplished so well for me was going from
barely being able to read the screen to beating the game over the
course of 10 minutes.  Admittedly it's a very short and simple game.
But I felt a sense of accomplishment every time my understanding of
the mechanics grew.

Oh, these little critters are stronger than these other little
critters, better avoid them.  Oh these are power ups, not critters,
better aim for them.  With these skills under my belt it only took a
little luck to send my character on a march toward victory.

The place where this idea shines is in the power-ups.  I'm not sure
whether I've encountered all of them, but they range from simple buffs
that grant free levels to expanding your party into a 3-character-wide
enemy-wrecking plow.  For what it's worth, the power-ups were deep
enough to keep me interested over 10 minutes of gameplay.  If I were
going to engage with this experience over a longer term, I would
suggest adding more depth to the power-ups and the enemies, which are
as far as I can tell simply harder to kill, and possibly bigger,
versions of the puny slimes that move back and forth.  Some of the
enemies have variations on the simple random walk style movement of
the slimes, but a richer variety of movement and behavior from the
enemies would increase the required skill to play the game, and add to
replayability.

I think the power-up mechanics add a level of depth and strategy to
what otherwise would be a hands-off luck-of-the-draw game.  By aiming
for power-ups you have a sense of agency in the action, just like
turning the knob controls the velocity at which pachinko balls are
launched.  It makes cheering for your lemming-like character(s) more
enjoyable: if they could just get a little closer and grab the
power-up you aimed at--no.  Nope, they died.

Go give this great little game a try.  Hopefully it will pique your
interest like it piqued mine.  Quirky variations on RPGs seem to be
part of the /Zeitgeist/, with /[[http://www.atlus.com/rollers/][Rollers of the Realm]]/ and /[[http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA][Monster
Strike]]/ combining pinball and console genre gameplay with the
potential synergy /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball][Sonic Spinball]]/ never achieved.

** Designing a pachinko RPG
- design
- mechanics

What would make a pachinko RPG?  [[http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/16/one-tap-quest-a-pachinko-rpg/][Last week]], I wrote about how I'm sort
of enamored with /[[http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/][One Tap Quest's]]/ tap-and-let-them-go interaction,
which I think mirrors the play-style of pachinko.  In pachinko, you
have some control over launching the little metal balls, but once
they're in play, they're on their own.  This mechanism stands in
contrast to pinball, where you interact with a single or multiple
pinballs with the paddles, and cue sports (especially bumper pool),
where you launch a billiard ball repeatedly with a cue.

As I said last week, I think the basic gameplay in /One Tap Quest/ is
interesting enough for a 10-minute session.  But I'd like to take this
concept and run with it, if you'll let me.  What follows are some
concepts that, I think, extend the /One Tap Quest/ pachinko RPG model.

*** Player characters
As I conceive of it, a pachinko RPG is sort of like /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_101][Wonderful 101]]/.
A changing stock of characters go up against an overwhelming group of
enemies.  Just like pachinko rewards players with more pachinko balls,
worth real money, a pachinko RPG would need to reward the player with
ever more--and ever more interesting--characters to bolster the stock
and the player's score.  A given character can gain levels when
unleashed on the board, a little more unique than generic pachinko
balls.  Perhaps characters added to the stock later in the game come
at a higher starting level, sort of like characters recruited in later
sections of /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics][Final Fantasy Tactics]]/ or /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_Battle:_The_March_of_the_Black_Queen][Ogre Battle]]/.

*** Environment
Procedurally generated "boards" could make a game interesting.
Presenting a variable layout of enemies, terrain, and power-ups can
challenge players who are already familiar with the basic gameplay.  I
don't think that using roguelike elements, such as varying the effects
of power-ups like potions in /[[http://www.nethack.org/][Nethack]]/ would work very well.  However,
incorporating a quest or narrative adventure framework above the level
of boards could be engaging.  Here I'm using the word level to refer
to a conceptual level of hierarchical relationships, rather than an
experience level or a stage in a game.  I'm talking about the approach
that /[[http://www.ftlgame.com/][FTL]]/ and the built-in 3DS RPG, /[[http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Find_Mii_(3DS)][Find Mii]]/, take.  Each "board"
is a gameplay experience in itself, and the "boards" have a larger (in
terms of conceptual scope) map that ties them together and gives the
player a sense of progression or quest completion.

Obstacles on the "boards" that impair the movement of either player
characters or enemies could add another layer of strategy.  In effect
these terrain elements could construct a puzzle that they player has
to solve by starting their player character down the correct "lane",
and being lucky enough to gain the required number of levels to beat
the "board".

This approach to using obstacles to make puzzles would require some
clever level design.  A puzzle where there is a single right way to
complete it would be boring, once you find it you simply wait until
you get the required number of levels through sheer luck--pointless
repetition without interesting choices.  However puzzles where there
are (or seem to be) multiple routes to complete the "board" can be
interesting.

*** Interaction
I think it might be cool to maintain control over the character after
you launch.  In a sense you would be an invisible hand, maintaining
control over the pachinko ball as it rolls through the machine.  This
game would be sort of like an inverted bullet-hell shoot 'em up.
Rather than dodging enemies, you would guide your character toward
them.  It is probably worth iterating on this mechanic, because
/[[http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA][Monster Strike]]/ seems to use it with relative success.  But I think
maintaining control over the character would block out the
cheering-your-character-on-from-the-sidelines aspect that I enjoyed in
One Tap Quest, and would like to emulate.

*** Enemies
As I mentioned previously, added depth of enemy behavior and power-ups
could prolong the experience.  I'm not sure exactly what this would
entail at this point, but I think iterating on the basic concepts laid
out in /One Tap Quest/ could lead to some interesting variation.  That
sentence pretty much sums up my take on what would make an interesting
pachinko RPG.  Thanks for letting me spew some thoughts that are
little more than design notes.

** Introduction
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG][{% img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/ChronoTriggerInside.PNG from Wikipedia%}]]
Image from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger][wikipedia.org]].

I recently revisited [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger][Chrono Trigger]], a 20-year-old Square role playing
game (RPG) for the SNES.  I was inspired by a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DV_SFck-xeGM][speed run]] from [[http://gamesdonequick.com/][Awesome
Games Done Quick]] 2012, a charity fundraiser featuring speed runs of
old and new school games.  If [[https://twitter.com/EssentiaFour][Essentia]] could [[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ChronoTrigger.html][beat the game in 5 hours]],
surely, copying her strategies, I could finish it in a reasonable
amount of time.

In the course of my play-through I grew curious about the underlying
mechanics of the Chrono Trigger battle system.  In order to optimize
speed running strategies, Chrono Trigger's mechanics have been
scrutinized to an obsessive degree.  There are numerous guides, one of
which is [[http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger/Formulae][here]].  But, none of the guides I found could clearly identify
the mechanics behind Chrono Trigger's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation][random number generator]] (RNG).

Most likely, under the hood, the RNG is a variation of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register][linear
feedback shift register]].  I recently came across a similar RNG in an
[[http://meatfighter.com/nintendotetrisai/#Picking_Tetriminos][in-depth article about the mechanics of NES Tetris]]. But I'm not
concerned with how the programmers implemented a good RNG.  I'm
concerned with the rules governing how that RNG interacts with the
battle system.

I'm gonna get a little pedantic here, bear with me. In an RPG combat
system, the RNG introduces an element of luck, which makes battles
more interesting and potentially ruining speed runs if not properly
understood.  The speed runners apparently compensate for any
variability of the RNG, but its mechanics have not been laid out.  So
I set out to investigate the mechanics of the RNG in Chrono Trigger,
using basic R commands to tease apart its underlying algorithms.

<!--more-->

** A brief note on the choice of R
There was no good reason to choose R for this analysis.  I chose R
because I was comfortable using it to quickly do the statistical
analyses summarizing a data set.

** Chrono Trigger's battle system

Chrono Trigger's battle system has two types of attacks: *[[http://chrono.wikia.com/wiki/Tech][Tech]]*
(including magic) and *[[http://chrono.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Chrono_Trigger_weapons][weapon attacks]]*.  The Tech system is more
complicated than the basic weapon attack system, so I'll focus on
weapon attacks for now.

Crono's basic weapon attacks use the formula:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Attack = ((Power * 4/3) + (Weapon * 5/9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some of the other characters' attacks use different formulas.  For the
sake of simplicity, I'm going to focus my analysis on Crono.

The parameters *Power (PWR)* and *Weapon* determine the base
amount of damage dealt when a weapon hits, using the formula:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Damage  = ((Attack * 2) + (Random))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the base damage Crono can deal, assuming *Random* is 0, is his
double *Attack* value.  This gives us a stable mark to observe the
variability of the RNG.

How is the random number determined?  To answer that question, I
set out to carefully analyze empirical data, accounting for the known
parameters of the *Damage* formula.  That's a fancy way of saying, I
hit the same enemies with the same weapons a bunch of times.  I kept
track of the damage dealt each time.

** Analysis and Observations
Crono begins the game with 5 *PWR* and his weapon is a Wood Sword,
which has a *Weapon* value of 3. Crono's *Attack* value is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Attack = ((5 * 4/3) + (3 * 5/9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So his *Attack* is 8⅓, which is rounded down to 8.  I think the
rounding down is equivalent to a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions][=floor= function]] because, in cases
where the calculated *Attack* value would have a fractional component
above half, the game always rounds down.

I store Crono's *Attack* power in a variable called =apwr=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  c.apwr <- 8

#+END_SRC

That means his base damage per hit is double that:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  calculated.hit <- 16

#+END_SRC

Now we observe a bunch of hits using these parameters.  This is no
simple task because Crono levels up after a few battles, changing the
value of his *Attack* parameter.  I kept the values consistent by
reloading, starting from scratch, each time Crono leveled up.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  ## Crono Level 1, Attack Power 8
  raw.hits <- c(32, 17, 16, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 32, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16,
                17, 32, 32, 17, 16, 17, 17, 16, 16, 17, 16, 34, 16, 17,
                16, 17, 16, 17, 16)

#+END_SRC

Here we've got a collection that samples 33 hits by Crono at level 1.

We can get summary statistics:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  summary(raw.hits)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> summary(raw.hits)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  16.00   16.00   17.00   18.97   17.00   34.00
#+END_EXAMPLE

So, the majority of hits did 16 or 17 damage.  A few were much higher
than that.  The hits doing 32 or 34 damage represent critical hits,
which I failed to realize, would contaminate my data set.  Critical
hits simply deal double damage, a fact you can see by the lack of hits
dealing 33 damage.

A critical hit dealing 33 damage would require raw damage of 16.5,
which would require representing floating point numbers.  Given what
we previously observed about the *Attack* calculation above, it should
come as no surprise that Chrono Trigger's battle system uses integers
only.

We'll ignore critical hits for now.

Crono's calculated damage value is 16.  We see that the hits vary
between 16 and 17.  So the added *Random* modifier is either 0 or 1.

The modifiers occur with about the same frequency, given the tiny sample
size:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  table(raw.hits)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> table(raw.hits)
raw.hits
16 17 32 34
12 16  4  1
#+END_EXAMPLE



** Summary

There are still questions that remain unanswered.

What RNG parameters govern levels 2 and 3?

Is the RNG governing the Tech system similar?

How does evasion work?  I haven't seen much information about missed hits.

Can I provide a concrete example of the *Attack* value rounding down
when its fractional value would be calculated to be above ½?

All told, it took me a little North of 12 hours to beat the game,
using Essentia's strategies.  I'm no speed runner.

Potential for platforms to become involved prior to release, free
advertising for devs and possible for platform owners to sell ads.  As
it stands, may make more money from straight-up advertising splits
with existing streaming platforms, but no pre-order it now button
incorporated with system.  Potential for more sales may outweigh
advertising revenue for devs.

I've noticed a trend toward livestreaming development emerging among
projects I follow on twitter. This is not because I'm particularly
observant.  It's obvious.

Devs will announce on twitter that they are going to develop for a few
hours, often working on a specific system or feature.  This is a
win-win situation because interested parties can watch and interact
with the dev; and because the developer is held accountable to work,
without goofing off on twitter, while simultaneously marketing to the
core audience.  There are, of course, costs, and the gamasutra article
by Brandon Sheffield does a good job pointing these out.

Of course, broadcasting video gameplay in the form of Let's Plays has
already skyrocketed in terms of viewership and monetization since 2009
(?).  The recent acquisition of Twitch, a popular livestreaming
platform, by YouTube for $1 billion clearly demonstrates the [[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/with-twitch-acquisition-talks-validation-of-games-as-spectator-sport/][value of
broadcasting games]].

Livestreaming has already caught on as a form a interactive content
production, the very production of which can itself be monetized.
Monetization, as such, is not always a selfish thing. Greed is good,
when that greed is directed toward leveraging these interactive
streaming platforms to raise funds for charity, as in the case of
Games Done Quick, Yogscast Christmas Drives, Desert Bus, and the Mario
Marathon.  These streamed charity events, and even non-charity
streams, can themselves then be edited, chopped & screwed into content
for the streamers normal non-streaming content delivery platform.

* Creating a Dictionary of Lists in Unity JavaScript
- JavaScript
- Unity
- tools
- algorithms

I ran into a few problems trying to create a [[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_Dictionary][Dictionary]] of [[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_List][Lists]] in
Unity JavaScript.  So I thought I'd share some of the tips I learned
here.

I'm interested in creating a Dictionary to hold Markov Chain
information to generate text.  So I'd like to be able to create a
Dictionary holding a variable length of items for each of its Keys.
I'd also like to be able to update the mapping at runtime.

It would look something like this:
- Key1 :: Item1, Item2, Item3
- Key2 :: Item4

At runtime, I'd like to be able to say: "Append =Item5= to =Key2=."

Here's what I came up with in Unity JavaScript.  I started out by
initializing a =table= in my script prior to the =Start= function. The
var =table= holds our mapping of Keys of type =String= to Values of
type =List.<int>=, or Lists of integers.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:3
  import System.Collections.Generic;
  // White space matters.
  var table:Dictionary.<String,List.<int> > = new Dictionary.<String,List.<int> >();
#+END_SRC

The first hiccup I ran into is that [[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/80227-Creating-a-Dictionary-of-Lists-in-Javascript?p%3D513471&viewfull%3D1#post513471][white space matters]], when creating
Generics in Unity JavaScript.  The compiler will throw an error if it
sees two =>>= in a row.

Then I fill the table with our test mappings.


#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:9
  // Fill our table with Lists containing ints using Arrays to intialize
  // the Lists.
  table["a"] = new List.<int>([1]);
  table["b"] = new List.<int>([2]);
  table["c"] = new List.<int>([3]);

#+END_SRC


As you can see, you can [[http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/221476/javascript-array-to-generic-list.html][construct a List from an Array]].  Cool.

In the =Start= function, I iterate over the Keys in the Dictionary,
Add the item =4= to the Value of Key =c=, and print out the first item
of each of the Values.  Finally, we check to see whether =4= was
appended to the desired entry.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:13
function Start () {
    // Iterate over the Keys in our Dictionary.
    for(var str:String in table.Keys) {
        // Get the value for our Key.
        var value:List.<int> = table[str];

        // If the Key is our desired Key, append to its list.
        if (str == "c") {
            value.Add(4);
        }

        // Print the first item in each of the Lists.
        print(value[0]);
    }

    // Print the appended item to see that it worked.
    print(table["c"][1]);

}
#+END_SRC

Then I attach this script to the Main Camera for testing purposes.
Bada bing, bada boom.

This was all relatively straightforward, after I understood some of
the quirks of Unity's JavaScript syntax.  On my github account, you
can find a repository of an example Unity project using this code
here.

* Probabilistic Entity Spawning in Unity JavaScript
- JavaScript
- Unity
- tools
- algorithms

The Unity documentation has an example showing how to generate random
indexes satisfying a distribution of probabilities.  In this post I'll
show you how to use a similar approach to generate random items with
specific probabilities dictated by the environment.

I want to be able to generate an item code, say =Red=, =Green=, or
=Black=, given a list of floating point probabilities dictated by the
current area, for example =desert= or =grassland=.

Varying the probability of encountering items will give each area a
unique flavor.  If the player needs a =Red= item, the player will need
to seek out areas in which the probability for encountering =Red=
items is high.  I hope this will drive player exploration and
investigation.

I'll start by defining an array of possible item types.  (According to
[[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Head_First_into_Unity_with_UnityScript#Use_enum][this introduction to Unity JavaScript]], I should prefer =enum=.)

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:5
  var ents : String[] = ["Red", "Green", "Black", "Orange"];
#+END_SRC

Then I define a Dictionary =areas= of Lists of floating point
probabilities.  These areas correspond to terrains that contain unique
distributions of items. The =areas= Dictionary accepts =strings=
specifying the desired terrain.

It's important to note that the order of the probabilities correspond
to the order of the item types in =ents=.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:7
  var areas = new Dictionary.<String, List.<float> >();
  areas["desert"] = new List.<float>([0.1, 0.05, 0.425, 0.425]);
  areas["grassland"] = new List.<float>([0.3, 0.35, 0.1, 0.25]);
#+END_SRC

So, in the =grassland= area, there will be a 30% chance of choosing a
=Red= item.

Now that we've defined our data, we need a function to choose the
appropriate index given a List of probabilities.  This function is
lifted with minor modifications from the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html][Unity Documentation]].

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:11
  function Choose(probs : List.<float>) : int {
      // Returns the index of a probabilistically determined random
      // entity, given by the probability distributions in probs.
      // e.g.:
      // probs : List.<float>([0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2]);
      // entity = entities[Choose(probs)];
      //
      // See [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html]]

      // Watch out!  If you fail to specify total's type as float, it
      // will add the probs using integer addition.  This will floor
      // each of the probs to 0.
      var total : float = 0;

      for (x in probs) {
          total += x;
      }

      var randomPoint = Random.value * total;

      for(var i = 0; i < probs.Count; i++) {
          if (randomPoint < probs[i])
              return i;
          else
              // Shift the strip down, adjusting the random point's
              // value to see whether it falls within the next prob.
              randomPoint -= probs[i];
      }
      // Take care of possibility that randomPoint is 1.0 or 100% by
      // returning the last element of probs.  Avoids allowing Choose to
      // return a 0 probability event (which would be possible using the
      // <= test).
      return probs.Count - 1;

  }
#+END_SRC

Now to choose an item:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:48
  var item = ents[Choose(areas["grassland"])];
  Debug.Log(item);
#+END_SRC

That's all there is to it. I've put an example Unity project with this
code on github.

* Sharing philosophy

[[http://www.imperica.com/en/in-conversation-with/meta-ex-the-music-of-code][This interview]] with Sam Aaron.


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

We believe that most value in the world comes through sharing, and
that music is no exception. One of the benefits of sharing is that it
makes learning much easier. For example, we often hear amazing sounds
on albums and wonder how they were made. However, musicians rarely
share their production methods. We release all the software we write,
which includes our synthesiser designs, interaction abstractions, and
compositional structures, under an open source license, and we
distribute it to everyone through GitHub. This makes it free and easy
for anybody to copy and recreate any aspect of our work. For example,
when one of our fans is interested in the sound of one of the synths
we're using, they can go to GitHub and download the synth design as
text. They can email it to their friends, read it, study it, copy it,
modify it and run it to recreate the exact sound.

[[http://csharptutorial.blogspot.com/2006/05/question-mark-ternary-operator.html]]

I ported a cool toy from [[http://alastaira.wordpress.com/2014/03/15/a-simple-mind-reading-machine/][Alastair Atchison's blog]] to Unity
JavaScript.  The toy implements a simple 'mind-reading' algorithm that
attempts to guess whether the player will choose Left (by pressing the
left arrow key) or Right (by pressing the right arrow key).

<!--more-->

** How does it work?

Atchison's blog post describes how it works:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How does it work? Not by mind-reading, obviously, but by exploiting
the fact that humans do not behave as "randomly" as they think they
do. The computer maintains a very simple memory that records the
pattern of results of the last two rounds – whether the player won or
lost, whether they switched strategy, and then whether they then won
or last the following round. The computer then uses this to choose its
own best strategy based on the way the player behaved last time the
current pattern occurred. If the computer loses twice in a row using
the current strategy, it picks a random response in the next round.
#+END_QUOTE

The original idea came from some AI work by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon][Claude Shannon]]
and D. W. Hagelbarger.  [[http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/ai.html][They describe the internal memory of the toy
mind-reader]] that we will model using a multidimensional array =v=:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are 8 possible situations and two things the player can do at each one:

1) player wins, plays same, wins. Then same or differently.
2) player wins, plays same, loses. Then same or differently.
3) player wins, plays differently, wins. Then same or differently.
4) player wins, plays differently, loses.Then same or differently.
5) player loses, plays same, wins.Then same or differently.
6) player loses, plays same, loses.Then same or differently.
7) player loses, plays differently, wins.Then same or differently.
8) player loses, plays differently, loses.Then same or differently.
#+END_QUOTE

** Why port it?
Why not just take a straightforward approach, running
his code myself? First, I wanted to fully understand the algorithm the
hard way, by coding it line for line myself. And second, I wanted to
better familiarize myself with Unity JavaScript, including its
differences from C#.

The port was relatively simple, except for two small hiccups.  First,
as far as I know, Unity JavaScript doesn't allow for initializing a
multidimensional array.  So I looped over the cells in the array,
filling them that way.  I have a hunch that the cells are initialized
to the =int= =0= by default, but I wanted to be explicit.  Please let
me know in the comments or [[https://twitter.com/zerosalife][via twitter]] if I'm way off base.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  var v : int[2, 2, 2];
  for(var cell in v) {
      cell = 0;
  }

#+END_SRC

I also encountered some unfamiliar syntax: the sonorously named Elvis
operator, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_operator][?:]].  It's also called the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation][ternary operator]], when it's used
with 3 arguments, as I've used it here.  In C-like languages it allows
for succinctly stating these kinds of conditional expressions. The
example below illustrates how it's used.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  // Is the current player's choice the same as the previous player's
  // choice?
  //
  // if (playerChoice == lastChoice)
  //     sameChoice = True;
  // else
  //     sameChoice = False;
  //
  // Using ternary operator:
  v[lw2, lw1, 1] = (v[lw2, lw1, 0] == playerChoice ? 1 : 0);

#+END_SRC

* Mobile Frame Football Association
From The Game Design Workshop book:

One good way to train yourself in the design of game mechanics is to
challenge urself with controlled design exercises in which you take an
existing game system, set a new player experience goal, and make
changes to the system to meet that goal

** Football games
*** Duration of play
Mobile Frame Football Association (MFFA) sanctioned games last 6
turns, consisting of two equal 3-turn halves.  MFFA rules do not allow
for the countdown mechanic from the vanilla Mobile Frame Zero (MF0)
rules.

*** Objective
When time expires, the player with the highest number of goals scored
wins.

*** Teams
Games are played between teams consisting of equal numbers of frames.
Frames may have up to 4 systems installed, with the usual vanilla MF0
benefits for fewer than 4 installed systems (see, e.g., MF0 p. 64).
For more explanation see /Dice Systems/.

*** Field of Play
The game field should be approximately the size of a normal MF0 table,
with goals the size of 1 /movement scale/ on each end of the field.
Lines should be laid out to clearly mark the in bounds/out of bounds
boundary.  There should be at least 1" of space on the sidelines, to
allow for units to be positioned outside of the field during out of
bounds situations.

The size of your available Field of Play can dictate the Movement and
Shooting Scales for your game.  The suggested defaults are based on a
normal MF0 table, your mileage may vary.

** Deployment
During the deployment phase, you may place your units anywhere on the
field in a legal formation.  Cool your servos, I'll describe the legal
formations in just a sec.

*** Beginning of play
At the beginning of the game, at the beginning of the second half, or
at a kickoff following a goal, players take turns placing units in
bounds, in the half of the field that has been assigned (See:
[[*Determining%20possession][Determining possession]]).  The player in possession of the ball, the
/offensive player/, goes first.  The ball, represented by a d12, is
placed at the center of the field. The offensive player must place a
unit next to the ball, this unit is in possession of the ball.

**** Maintaining possession of the ball
A unit possesses the ball if the ball is in contact with its base
(i.e. its legs).  If two opposing units are in contact with the ball
the unit in possession of the ball first maintains possession unless
the opposing unit steals or tackles.  Similarly if two units on the
same side are in contact with the ball, the unit in possession of the
ball first maintains possession unless it passes successfully to the
second unit.

**** Determining possession at kickoff
A coin flip determines possession at the beginning of the game, with
the winning player electing to be on offense or defense first.  The
losing player gets to determine the side of the field in which to
deploy.

At the half, the possession and sides switch.  Following a scored
goal, the player who was scored on gains possession of the ball at the
kickoff.

*** After a dead ball situation
Play is stopped due to a foul, an out of bounds ball. This is called
a /dead ball/ situation.

**** Out of bounds
Out of bounds balls force a turnover of possession. The ball is placed
on the sideline where it went out of bounds.

Both players may redeploy their units, however the offensive player
may not place a unit beyond the defensive unit closest to the goal.
The defensive player places first, and must move the unit closest to
the goal first, if it will be moved in the redeployment.  Players
alternate placing units.  The offensive player must place a unit next
to the ball.

After the offensive player redeploys the last unit, play resumes with
the unit next to the ball immediately taking its turn, regardless of
its initiative roll.  If the unit next to the ball has an initiative
die, remove it.

***** Corner Kicks and Goal Kicks
Corner kicks occur when a defending unit kicks the ball out of bounds
on the sideline running on its own 'goal' side of the field.  The ball
is placed on the corner sideline on the side it went out of bounds.

Goal kicks occur when an offensive unit kicks the ball out of bounds
on the sideline of the defensive units' 'goal' side of the field.  The
ball is placed in front of the goal.

**** Fouls
Fouls do not force a turnover of possession.  Redeployment following a
foul occurs the same as in the [[*Out%20of%20bounds][Out of bounds]] situation.

**** Redeployment and units that have already taken turns
Redeployment does not normally reset whether a unit has taken its
turn.  If the unit placed next to the ball in a dead ball situation
has already taken its turn, it gets a free turn taken immediately
following deployment, when play resumes.

** Initiative
For the time being, MFFA uses the older per-unit turn order from MF0
(p. 136).  Enough with the hutching bellyaching, you yabbies.

Players roll 1d10 for each unit, placing the die next to the unit.
Initiative starts at 1 and counts up.  When you reach a unit's
initiative roll in the count, remove the initiative die next to the
unit, that unit takes its turn.

If two units have the same roll, when their number is reached, reroll
the initiative dice. Lowest roll goes first with the next highest
reroll going immediately after.  Once all of the rerolled ties have
been resolved, the initiative count continues as normal.

In a dead ball situation, the initiative count does not reset.

*** Coaching
Coaching adds a layer of complexity to initiative determination.  It
may slow down the game a bit, but it allows for extra tactical
decisions.

Coaching allows players to take control of the assignment of
initiative to each of their units.  Both players roll a number of
initiative dice equal to their units, then take turns assigning to
initiative dice to their units. The defensive player chooses first.
After initiatives are assigned, the initiative count starts and counts
up as normal.


** Dice systems
As in MF0, frames have 2 white dice representing the frame chassis
plus other dice representing up to 4 additional systems.  Frames get
the usual vanilla MF0 benefits for having fewer than 4 installed
systems (see, e.g., MF0 p. 64).

*** Red dice
Red dice represent the ability of a frame to shoot or pass the ball on
offense.  Unlike the vanilla MF0 rules, there are two legal ranges for
red dice on offense: direct and artillery.  Systems granting hand to
hand dice are not rolled on offense.

When shooting, you must score a successful hit on the goal using the
difficulty table from MF0 to score a goal.  When passing you must
score a successful hit on your ally to successfully pass the ball. You
must declare the range you will be targeting at the beginning of your
turn.

On defense, red dice represent steals (hand to hand range) and slide
tackles (direct range).  Systems granting artillery dice are not
rolled on defense.

Red dice use a special scale that is different from the movement
scale.  See [[*Movement%20Scale%20and%20Shooting%20scale][Movement Scale and Shooting Scale]]

**** Passing and shooting
When in range for a shot or a pass, the player must roll a number of
/hit dice/ equal to the /shot value/ minus the blue /defense value/ of
any units in the line of fire.  Any units in the line of
the pass or shot act as cover, using the normal MF0 cover rules.  If
there is doubt, consult the MF0 cover rules to determine if a unit is
in the line of fire.

If the rolled hit dice successfully /score a hit/, then the ball goes
where the offensive player wants, into the goal or into the possession
of another unit.  Use Damage chart 2 from the MF0 rules (Hit target on
a 5 or 6) if there is no other unit between the shooter and the
target.  Use Damage chart 4 if there is a unit between the shooter and
the target. (Hit target on a 6)

Failure to score a hit is called a /fumble/, and causes the ball to go
wide somewhere in the range of the shot at the opposing player's
discretion (be reasonable here, it's not going to /fly backwards/).
This may cause the ball to go out of bounds, into the possession of a
unit, into the goal, or into the field of play.

**** Stealing and slide tackling
When stealing or slide tackling, /scoring a hit/ results in the ball
coming into the stealing or tackling unit's possession.  The stealing
or tackling unit's player rolls a number of /hit dice/ equal to its
red /shot value/ for the steal or tackle attack minus the blue
/defense value/ of the unit in possession of the ball.

Always use Damage chart 2 for stealing and slide tackling. On a roll
of 5 or 6, the steal or slide tackle scores a hit.  Possible rule: the
player who slide tackles to steal the ball may choose to destroy a
system on the opposing player's unit.

Failure to score a hit is a /fumble/.  Nothing special happens, unless
the player rolls a 1 on one of the hit dice.

Rolling a 1 on a hit die during a fumble results in a foul.  See
/Fouls/.

*** Blue Dice
Blue dice systems remain the same as blue dice systems in the normal
MF0 rules.  However, rather than representing armor, they represent
the ability of a unit to gain or maintain control of the ball.

*** Yellow Dice and Green Dice
Yellow and green dice systems remain the same as vanilla MF0.

*** Hot rodding
A player may choose to hotrod a unit's system by sacrificing a system
to gain a free action with one of the other systems after the unit has
taken its turn.

** Taking a turn
Taking a turn begins with target declaration.  For the defensive units
this will generally be the unit in possession of the ball.  For the
offensive unit in possession of the ball, this could be targeting a
fellow offensive unit for a pass or targeting the opposing goal.

Attacks don't do anything to units without the ball.  Save that
animosity for the war.

The turn proceeds as per the vanilla MF0 rules. Any unit that would be
activated with the normal MF0 turn rules, i.e. the target of a steal
attempt or a pass, takes its turn as per those rules.

For example: If a unit equipped with a blue system is in the line of
fire and has not rolled to determine the blue /defense value/ this
turn, defending player must declare a target for the unit, roll all of
the unit's dice, and assign a /defense value/.  The unit takes its
turn as normal when its initiative dictates.

** Movement Scale and Shooting Scale

Normal vanilla MF0 scale is 2".  /Shooting scale/ for MFFA is 2".
/Movement scale/ is double that, 4", to represent the agility of these
hot-rodded sportsframes.

Using two different colored rulers (e.g., 1 red for shooting and 1
green for movement) is a good way to distinguish /movement scale/ and
/shooting scale/.

* Simulation Sandbox vs Theme Park
This quote from the artist @sougwen resonates with me because I feel
it encapsulates some aspect of game design.

{% tweet https://twitter.com/sougwen/status/462994273898872832 %}

I don't mean to simply say that sougwen is talking about art and games
are art, so this quote resonates.  No.  I think that there is
something to this carving-out-of-allowed-play that is fundamental to
games.

Theme parks are about creating spectacle rather than true interactivity.

* Improvisation vs Preparation
This week I look at how games from JoshuaACNewman, handle
Improvisation vs Preparation as modes of play

Or preparation as play.

This post was inspired by hearing about long set-up times eating into
time-crunched play time for busy adults.

As young adults with minimal time commitment it was nothing to spend
hours preparing for a gaming session among friends.  There was little
concern for an hour or two spent setting up a wargaming afternoon.
But as adults these time commitments quickly eat-in to or completely
consume any time that would otherwise be spent having fun, gaming with
your friends.

Certain games lend themselves more to the /preparation/ side of things
than the /improvisation/ side.

Consider the examples I mentioned above, a gamemaster driven
roleplaying game and a tabletop war game.  Certainly these are fun
pastimes but they require preparation on the part of the individual or
all parties involved.  Roleplaying games require, at least initially,
the generation of player characters for all involved, potentially
consuming the entire first play session.  The gamemaster is required
to plot out a scenario for each play session, necessitating an
substantial noninteractive time investment outside of the normal play
session.  For war games, players must spend time constructing armies,
generally away from the normal interaction at the table.

In the thick of the actual game, both roleplaying and tabletop gaming
can be fun and improvisiational in the same way as the sorts of games
I'm calling /improvisiational/.  I don't deny that.

How does this differ from say playing stickball or baseball with your
friends in an alley or a field with just a stick and a ball?  The game
starts when the minimally necessary instruments arrive and continues
even as players come and go.  It's almost heinous to interrupt these
sorts of improvised games, hence the saying "taking the ball and going
home."

To stretch this metaphor beyond its limit: in this syllogism, the
polar opposite of pickup baseball or basketball would be ice hockey,
something requiring potentially hours of preparation by a Zambonist to
prepare the playing surface so the players can play for a relatively
short time.

Some roleplaying games provide hook generation tables.  Sometimes
rolling on random tables to generate encounters can feel like play,
but it's a relatively lifeless mechanic.

There are a few games that get preparation as play mechanics right,
but I think there is still room for improvement.

  - Shock

  - Fate Core

  - Prime Time Adventures

  - Microscope

  - How to Host a Dungeon

These games all turn the world gen and character background into an
gameplay activity, typically performed during the first group play
session.  Shock even does away with the necessity of a GM, allowing
players to take turns serving as protagonists, antagonists, or neutral
third parties.  These examples go a long way toward what I mean by
preparation as play, but I don't think they've captured it entirely.

What I'm looking for is a separate /asynchronous/ type of game, where
preparation has its own mechanics that boil down to a solo game unto
itself.  The results of the each player's solo game(s) are then
somehow incorporated and allowed to influence the collaborative group
play session.

* Nontraditional game jams

Game jams need not simply vary in terms of theme or duration.  There
are plenty of interesting axes upon which they can be projected for
new and interesting results.

** Game jam as recruitment
Game jams are typically thought of as a way for *participants* to
network.  And they are.  Game jams are unique, if not the most casual
and carefree, spaces for meeting and trial collaboration with others.

But that's not all.  You, yes I mean you, as an organizer are in a
unique position to network with talented game makers of all stripes.
Looking for pixel artists?  Organize a 48 hour game jam with pixel art
graphics as a constraint and a theme of your choice.

Yes, it could be considered manipulative, possibly unscrupulous or
unethical, but no one is twisting anyone's arm to participate.  And,
there's no reason not to be transparent when organizing the game jam.
Say you're looking for great pixel art because you would like to
collaborate on a specific idea.

There's one benefit of recruiting from willing participants in game
jams.  THese are poeple with at least enough free time to commit to
participating in a game jam.  They may be more approachable than
people who are otherwise tied up and unable to commit 24 hours, 48
hours, or a week to start and finish a project.

W.G. Armintrout made a similar plea in a Space Gamer Magizine issue
from 1982, (#52).

* Let's plays are some of the best feedback a designer can get
Imagine having to provide a questionaire with a game prototype to
solicit feedback on a design.  It may look something like this:

1. How much did you play? (approximate number of games)
2. Did you enjoy the game? If so, what made it enjoyable?
3. Was anything broken? Was anything not enjoyable, tedious, fiddly etc?
4. Were the rules/objectives understandable?
5. Any suggestions for improvement or comments?

Now imagine looking over a player's shoulder during the entire
playtesting experience.

Let's play videos and reports represent an entertaining and imminently
watchable form of playtesting.

* Rectangles for Prototyping in Unity 2d for Dummy
- Unity
- design
- prototype
- UnityJS

I'm the dummy.  Prototyping with 2d boxes in Unity has proven
surprisingly hard.  I think the difficulty I'm having is that I'm not
exactly sure what I'm trying to do.  What follows is an example of
*one* way (notice that I didn't say THE *RIGHT* WAY) to prototype with
2d rectangles in Unity.  I'm still too much of a noob to have strong
opinions on the right way to go about doing this.  Expect more posts
on this topic as I develop my expertise.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability][Discoverability]] is something I prize in programming languages and
environments, especially when I'm learning them.  While Unity's
documentation is thorough, the lack of congruence between the GUI
environment and coding leads to poor discoverability.  There's not a
one-to-one correspondence between the labels for =Components= in the
GUI inspector and their names and attributes in code.

Most of the time, Google is my method for discovering new
functionality in Unity.  The problem with this method, and even the
documentation, is that I'm never quite sure if the solution I've found
is the best solution, the only way to do something, or the wrong way
to do something.

I'm trying to get simple rectangular boxes to work in Unity 2d for
prototyping movement, hitboxes for attacsk, etc.  The information I
can find either deals with real-deal-Holyfield sprites or =GUIBoxes=.
It will be nice to work with =Sprites= eventually, but I just want to
get a box that can walk around and jump, at this point.  =GUIBoxes=
seem like the wrong type of boxes, if I want to prototype something
that will eventually be a =Sprite=.


As near as I can tell, the =Sprite= is a new way of making a flat 2D
=Plane= in Unity.  I couldn't seem to find anything dealing with
=Sprites= without creating them in the Unity GUI interface.

So, I started out following a Unity Answers question [[http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/139808/creating-a-plane-mesh-directly-from-code.html][here]].

** Getting the Mesh to gel

First, I created a brand-spankin new Unity 2D project.  I had to
create an empty =GameObject= to host my =PlaneTest.js= script
=Component=.  I included a variable =size= to control the size of the
box, so you can play around with that in the Editor interface.

Next, I had to create a =Mesh= that would be the actual geometry of
the plane.  Now, the =Mesh= I'm making differs from the stock Unity
=Plane= =GameObject=.  [[http://www.third-helix.com/2012/02/making-2d-games-with-unity/][This blog post]] shows that Unity's =Plane=
defaults to a 10 x 10 quad mesh with a couple hundred triangles.  A
quad is just a square made of two triangle faces, [[http://blog.nobel-joergensen.com/2010/12/25/procedural-generated-mesh-in-unity/][this blog post]] goes
into more detail.

Here we [[http://i.eho.st/pgtxqdii.gif][do it live]] by defining a =name= =String=, an =array= of
=Vector3= =vertices=, an =array= of =uv= texture coordinates, and an
=array= of =triangles= faces.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
    var m: Mesh = new Mesh();
    m.name = "Scripted_Plane_New_Mesh";
    m.vertices = [Vector3(-size, -size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(size, -size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(size, size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(-size, size, 0.01)];
    m.uv = [Vector2(0, 0),
            Vector2(0, 1),
            Vector2(1, 1),
            Vector2(1, 0)];
    m.triangles = [0, 1, 2,
                   0, 2, 3];
#+END_SRC

** Who you calling normal?

At one point I thought I had to =RecalculateNormals=, according to the
Unity Answers example above.  But it doesn't seem to make a
difference.  Here's a great example of the Unity discoverability
problem.  Since it doesn't /seem/ to make a difference, I don't know
whether to trust the Unity Answers that received 5 upvotes or to go
with parsimony.

A little more digging [[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/210399-4-3-Sprites-and-Lighting][reveals]] that normal maps are particularly
important for lighting.  Since the =Sprite Shader= I intend to use
don't use normal maps, we can leave it out.

** OBJECTION!!

Time to create the =GameObject= that will hold a =MeshRenderer=,
=MeshFilter=, and =MeshCollider=.  According to the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-MeshFilter.html][docs]], a
=MeshFilter= takes a mesh, like the one we created above, and passes
it to the =MeshRenderer= for rendering to the screen.  Not sure what
it's /filtering/ or why there's an intermediate =Component=, but there
you go.  The [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-MeshRenderer.html][docs]] say the =MeshRenderer= then takes the geometry from
the =MeshFilter= and renders it on the screen at the position defined
by the =GameObject='s =Transform=.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var obj: GameObject = new GameObject("New_Plane_From_Script",
                                       MeshRenderer,
                                       MeshFilter,
                                       MeshCollider);
  obj.GetComponent(MeshFilter).mesh = m;
#+END_SRC

** Time for texture

Next we create a =Texture2D= to hold the color information so the box
has some panache.  The =Texture2D= goes into the =MeshRenderer='s
=mainTexture= slot.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var texture: Texture2D;
  texture = new Texture2D(size, size, TextureFormat.ARGB4444, false);
  obj.renderer.material.mainTexture = texture;


#+END_SRC

I don't know too much about how =Texture2D= works right now, but
there's plenty to read in the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html][docs]].


** A splash of color
Here we generate some random RGB values, normalize them for Unity's
0.0-1.0 colorspace and make a =Color= to put into the =MeshRenderer='s
color slot.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var red: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var green: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var blue: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var color = Color(red, green, blue);
  obj.renderer.material.color = color;
#+END_SRC

** The crucial shader
At this point, I tested my code and got no errors. However, to my
surprise I didn't see anything rendered on the screen.

I learned that I needed to use a =Sprite Shader= to get the colored
mesh to render properly.  Here's how I did it:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var spriteShader: Shader = Shader.Find("Sprites/Default");
  obj.renderer.material.shader = spriteShader;
#+END_SRC

** Boxes for dummy
I don't feel so dumb anymore because this was a complex process.  And
it wasn't until the very last crucial step that I saw anything
remotely box-like.

I've posted the code to a gist [[https://gist.github.com/zerosalife/743cf797112d62978bec][here]] so you can clone the script for
yourself, to give it a whirl.  I found that setting =size= to 2 is a
nice place to start.

* Math Team Hearts
- design
- mechanics
- game
- rules

Math Team Hearts is a speedy modification to Hearts that ironically
involves less math than the vanilla game.

From The Game Design Workshop book:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One good way to train yourself in the design of game mechanics is to
challenge yourself with controlled design exercises in which you take
an existing game system, set a new player experience goal, and make
changes to the system to meet that goal.
#+END_QUOTE

** The Goal
We needed a game that played quickly, without a defined endpoint
(e.g. when one player reaches 100 points in normal Hearts) because
this game was played in free time waiting for school to start or
waiting for the bus.  There was no time to spend tallying up scores,
counting hearts and doing awkward math.

The rules also modify the risk-reward value of shooting the moon to
make it more attractive.  We found the game to be more interesting
when multiple parties were invested in shooting the moon with less
drawback from accumulating hearts.

** The Rules
The game plays like normal Hearts, except taking hearts no longer
gives you points.

- Taking hearts without shooting the moon gives you 0 points.
- Taking no hearts in a round gives you 1 point.
- Shooting the moon gives you 2 points.
- Taking the Queen without shooting the moon gives you -1 point.

The player with the most points at the end of play wins.

For more variety, use the Dealer's choice drafting rules.  Each round,
the Dealer decides on how players will pass cards prior to play.

* Gamifying Games
Something on top of score counting and death states and
progression. Speed running. Turn taking.  GTA start with 5 stars and
try to stay alive the longest.  Trying to get the game to glitch out.
Playing with systems rather than playing the game or the narrative
within the game.  More bang for your buck, maybe not a problem today,
but definitely a problem growing up when you got one or two new games
a year.

Offers a sense of empowerment by extending the life of a product that
has been otherwise consumed, outside of the commercial drive to move
on to the next thing.

My favorite term, gaminess, comes from Michael Cook in a comment on
this very blog.  Gaminess captures the odd taste left in my mouth when
I use the buzzword gamify.

[[http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/v/susd-play-megagame/]]

To get more people involved, restrict information.  Only people
playing certain roles have access to critical gameplay information.
They also become more invested in the game because they make mechanics
determinations, a fancy way of saying dice rolls, for the team.  This
also creates an organic distrust between the players on the same team
later in the game that creates interesting /intrateam/ dynamics to go
along with the already interesting /interteam/ dynamics.

* Is House of Leaves a game?
In [[*Space%20is%20Read][the post about Space is Read]] I talked a bit about interactive media
versus more traditional noninteractive media.  That's just a fancy way
of saying games versus, for example, books.  Needless to say, if you
haven't read Mark Z. Danielewski's excellent book, here be spoilers.

The House in /House of Leaves/ is a Big Dumb Object, that's larger on
the inside than the outside.  In this case, I
guess it's a Big Sinister Object.

* The map and the territory.
- design
- level design

Thinking about classic platformer maps as examples of good game
design.  Not just thinking about level design, but that's a big part.
Also thinking about beauty and elegance in achieving some level of
communication with the player, both in the aesthetic and practical
sense.  Jeremy Parish has looked at this sort of thing from a holistic
perspective in the Anatomy of Games series.

And others:
[[http://www.themmnetwork.com/blog/2012/08/19/a-critical-look-at-mega-man-3-stages-snake-man]]
[[http://www.themmnetwork.com/blog/?tag%3DA%2BCritical%2BLook%2Bat][http://www.themmnetwork.com/blog/?tag=A+Critical+Look+at]]

Here I'd like to examine how the artifacts of design can communicate
the intention behind the choices made for the design, to the extent
that's at all possible.  I hope that by coming up with a working
vocabulary for this type of classic design, future designers can
leverage it to not only improve their techniques, but to build
systems, based on this design syntax, that can design in a realistic,
authorial manner.

I'll be looking at maps hosted on [[http://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/PC/index.htm#MegaManIII][vgmaps.com]] and speed runs and other
examples of play.

In a way, design for interactive media is a way of communicating.  The
designer, or more classically author, communicates with the player
asynchronously.  At each turn, the designer must think like a player,
novice to advanced, and create clever scenarios to keep the player
intrigued.  In the medium of the platformer genre, the elements of
design communication are the level and the enemies, which are
minibosses, bosses, or cannonfodder.  The designer rarely has a chance
to see how the game will be played before the ability to refine or
modify the design is long gone.

* Secrets and Glitches
Axiom Verge is an in development game that elevates glitches from
quirky bugs into generative gameplay content.

The article makes a point of mentioning very old memory manipulation
glitches.  Due to more modern programming practices, these don't crop
up as much these days.  Here's an example from Final Fantasy III
(using Japanese numbering here):

[[http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/NES/FinalFantasy3.html]]

In more recent games there are still glitches that players exploit to
gain an advantage for speed runs.  Here's an example of RNG
manipulation from Symphony of the Night:

[[http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/PSX/SymphonyOfTheNight.html]]

This is not to say that modern games are in any way invulnerable to
memory manipulation tricks.  I think there are two reasons that these
glitches haven't been shown in modern games.  First, automated memory
management and smarter programming through explicit checks will
(probably) protect against some of the old memory manipulation tricks.
Second, there simply hasn't been enough time spent poking at these
games.  People have been playing some of these older games for 30 or
40 years.

* Shovel Knight's Old-school Tricks

Great article about parallax scrolling and  plenty of other stuff from
Shovel Knight:
[[http://gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidDAngelo/20140625/219383/Breaking_the_NES_for_Shovel_Knight.php]]

Even some indies are getting into the spirit:
[[https://twitter.com/NoelFB/status/487185061972680705/photo/1]]

Interview with the Shovel Knight creators Yacht Club Games:
[[https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/connectivity/38203/episode-144-ive-seen-some-badass-canes]].
The interview starts about 28 minutes into the podcast.

** Resolution
Shovel Knight runs on displays meant to run 1080p down to pocket-sized
3DS screens.  The fine article mentions that scaling Shovel Knight's
NES-style graphics up to 1080p results in virtual pixels of about 4.5
x 4.5 1080p pixels.  It also mentions that the effective resolution
they shoot for is 400 x 240, resulting in an aspect ratio of 5:3.
According to the fine article and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_technical_specifications][wikipedia]], that's pretty close to a
stretched out version of the original NES resolution.  For nothing
else but my own reference here, the DS' resolution is 256 x 192,
according to [[http://www.usgamer.net/articles/final-fantasy-iii-pc-port][this article]].  The Gameboy is 160 x 144 according to
[[http://jams.gamejolt.io/gbjam3][#gbajam]].  Typical NES background tiles are 16 x 16 pixels, foreground
sprites are either 8 x 8 or 8 x 16 (Sources:
[[http://wayofthepixel.net/index.php?topic%3D10784.5%3Bwap2][http://wayofthepixel.net/index.php?topic=10784.5;wap2]];
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_technical_specifications]]).

And [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo_(system)][NeoGeo]] is:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Display[edit]
Display resolution: 320×224 (many games only used the centermost 304 pixels)
Color palette: 65,536 (16-bit) (Not RGB565, but RGB666, where the lowest bit of each channel is shared with one bit[14])
Maximum colors on screen: 4,096 (12-bit)
Maximum sprites on screen: 380
Minimum sprite size: 1×2
Maximum sprite size: 16×512
Maximum sprites per scanline: 96
Simultaneous scroll planes: 3
Aspect ratio: 4:3
#+END_QUOTE

And LDTV is:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-definition_television#References]]

More modern resolutions considered:
[[http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-what-is-the-best-screen-resolution-for-your-game--gamedev-14723]]

So the Shovel Knight screen is 25 x 15 tiles.

I find choosing an aesthetically pleasing aspect ratio to be a crucial
design decision; one that I often approach on a trial and error basis.
Knowing what others have--in my humble opinion successfully--chosen
gives a nice starting point /a priori/ for projects with similar
scope.

** Backgrounds

** One comment on designer-player interaction through design

According to [[http://www.usgamer.net/articles/inside-shovel-knights-launch][this article]] by Chris Holt, the Shovel Knight designers
were realtively wishy washy about including the fishing pole.  For the
record, I like the addition of yet another superfluous minigame.  And
it's useful for fishing up money bags left in pits when you die, so
there.

The use of sparkles to mark pits containing potential fishing spoils
illustrates a clever bit of design and interaction with the player
through design.  You, the player, will notice that the pit in the
fish-themed level has the sparkles.  So, naturally, you're very likely
to fish there.  Bada-bing bada-boom: fish spoils.  The designers have
communicated what the sparkles in the pits mean without having to
resort to lame exposition from a tutorial or a helper character.

The great games of the NES-era that Shovel Knight emulates were
littered with these kinds of ingenious communicative design patterns.
Here's [[http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3][an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto]] talking about the deliberate
design behind communicating the purpose of the iconic mushroom
power-up in Super Mario Bros.

** Another fine example of introducing new mechanic in Shovel Knight.

In Treasure Knight's level you come across rocket platforms that fly
horizontally when you activate a lever by hitting it with your shovel.
For my play-through this was the first time I encountered these
platforms.

Since they are your means of conveyance to avoid spikes below, the
devs could have been mischievous about it. As your intrepid game
design blogger is well versed in virtual button pressing, my first
reaction is to hop on the platform and press boot-ton--viciously
strike the lever with the shovel. Ah, but doing so leads to a spikey
death for those with slow reaction times--your intrepid blogger, yeah,
yeah.

The second time through YIB, meaning me, and likely you, meaning you,
would be more wary; carefully timing the necessary jump to avoid the
spikes. The devs, in their wise and studied ways, saw fit to embed a
dig-able reward nugget in the wall. It's lodged in such a way that
when you knock it loose it lands just so, so when you shovel it to
dislodge the pecuniary treats within, you also hit the lever,
activating te rocket platform. Now you know to look ahead and
carefully time your jump. No harm no foul. No wordy tutorial, telling
you, "Hey, listen. This platform shoots off when you hit the lever."

You learned the new mechanic, and thus the behavior necessary to
interact with it, through previously ingrained behavior beaten into
your head with a thousand gem pickups.  It's devilishly clever.

* 8 bit vs 16 bit color
Listening to the Upper Memory Block Podcast [[http://umbcast.com/episode-22-rollercoaster-tycoon/][Railroad Tycoon episode]]
(start listening at 30:27 for the specific segment on Tech).

3 bits of 8 represent red
3 bits rep green
2 bits for blue

So, 256 colors

2 bytes to map color, 16 bit color

5 bits for red and blue
6 bits for green

Note: I'm assuming that these values are for DOS games, and may not
apply to consoles ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_technical_specifications][like the NES]]).

* INSceptahdeckWU
- design
- procedural generation
- clojure

I'm at it again.  Making a twitter bot like styx_ebooks.  Only this
time it's in a completely different language and it's got a compltely
different corpus.  Corpus is a Latin way of saying text, in case you
forgot.

** Making the corpus


** Making it a command line app
This is the first time I've tried to make a command line application
in Twitter.  Luckily there are some good tools out there.

I wondered how to deal with multiple options and inputs, and the good
news is: it's just as easy as you'd think.  You simply add
conditionals to deal with the possible behaviors of your program.  The
magic of =parse-opts= handles the rest.  Options with long names
automatically become keys to the option dictionary, and if you've
marked them as a =:flag= you can depend on the truth-value to control
the flow of your program.

You may think it's odd that I'm using options instead of actions as in
the =cli= example, but hey.  It's my program.  Your program can work
the way you want it too.  I'm going to make sure to document it so you
can use the Rebel INS or build a twitter bot based on this code.

** Markov chain text generation
One of the quirks of the markov package I used is that it stops
generating 'random walks' when it reaches states that it has not been
trained on.  As you can imagine when using imagery-rich,
neologism-laden rap music, there are many words that occur once, even
in a very large corpus.  Being unique is kind of a goal of the form, a
fact reflected in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol%2527_Dirty_Bastard][at least one alias]].

In order to make more realistic texts, it's common to increase the
order of the transition matrix.  That is to say, to determine the
probability for a following word from the prior two or more words.
However, given my idiosyncratic corpus, this leads the 'random walk'
algorithm to halt, giving me too few words in my output.

Interestingly, in this case, dialing back the order tends to lead to
more rhyming and a few recognizable couplets, which I find kinda nice.

** Moving on
From here the skies the limit.  I could try analyzing the generated
text to try to build lines or stanzas.  I could try to reorder words
to reflect the syntax present from the transcription.  I could try to
represent individual emcees with unique corpora.



* Mario Design Interview

Distilling an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto.

- design

In the interest of preserving an interview that could easily vanish
into the ether following a Nintendo website redesign, I'm going to
collect some wisdom from [[http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/0][an Iwata Asks with Shigeru Miyamoto]].

** Elements of a fun game
- "A fun game should be easy to understand -- you should be able to
  take one look at it and know what you have to do straight away."
- "It should be so well constructed that you can tell at a glance what
  your goal is and, even if you don't succeed, you'll blame yourself
  rather than the game."
- "The people standing around watching the game have also got to be
  able to enjoy it."
** Form follows function
A repeated theme that emerges in the interview is that constraints of
the hardware or display technology restricted the designs.  Miyamoto
and crew had to come up with simple, evocative designs that
communicate the function for each of the entities in the game world.
Following the maxim that a fun game should be easy to understand,
straightforward designs that show an entity's purpose in an easily
recognizable manner communicate the designer's intent to the player.
** Try it and see
Gameplay staples from the Mario series that seem unequivocally
well-designed emerged from a simple iterative prototyping process.
The designers had an idea, for example, "What if we double the size of
our main character?"  They then implemented it in a development build
of the game, and tested it out to see if it was fun.  By testing this
particular design choice, the designers came up with the idea for a
mechanic in the game to double the size of the main character as the
result of picking up a power-up.
** Communicating through design
The simple introduction of the mushroom power-up is a clever bit of
communication through the design of a level.  By this point the player
has likely learned that stomping on Goombas squashes them.  The
placement of a power-up block above the player situates it so you have
no choice but to hit it when you try to squash the Goomba.  By keeping
the player trapped under a line of blocks, the power-up has time to
bounce off of a pipe (blatantly informing the player that power-ups
can bounce) and the player is likely to run into it, thus discovering
its purpose.

Notice how the construction of the level (one of the elements of fun),
its design, makes it easy to understand (another element of fun) the
function of these power-ups.  At no point is it necessary to wrest
control of the player to blabber on about what power-ups are, why the
player may want to pick them up, what other power-ups exist in the
world, /et cetera ad infinitum ad nauseum/.
** Feel and smell
These two terms refer to the subjective aesthetic impression of the
perceptual and interactive elements of a game.  These can be a nice
way to distinguish your game from the others out there.

Miyamoto uses the term smell to refer to the overall impression that a
game leaves on your senses.  By really making a distinct impression on
the player, the experience is likely to stick, leading to
replayability.

The feel of a game refers to the subjective feeling the player gets
when pressing buttons on the controller.  Every game uses the same
controller (more or less), but the feeling that a player gets upon
pressing a button can differ drastically depending on the game.
Miyamoto mentions, and I agree, that sound effects have a huge impact
on the feel of a game.

The people behind the Nuclear Throne wiki have put this philosophy
into practice.  The wiki has screen shake every time you click the
mouse, and there's an easter egg where pressing a button will play the
sound of an airhorn.  I'm going to go on record here and say that the
airhorn onomatopoeia shall henceforth be:
"Byubyubyubyubyuuuuuuuuuuuuu."

Bullets shouldn't be small.  It's no fun when they're small.  Make it
about the size of the character's chest.  Also make the first frame of
animation a circle so that you have a muzzle flash.

Pause the action for 20 ms when something cool happens.  That's about
10% of [[http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/stats.php][average human reaction time]].  So, ignoring nonhuman players,
that means that this introduces a subliminal pause that adds a kind of
weight to the action.

* The Yogscast blowback and Generation Like

At the risk of participating in the culture characterized as callow
and vapid by the very documentary I'm sharing, I'd like to call
attention to some of the points made in
[[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/]] because I
think they shed light on the recent dust-up with the Yogscast.
Specifically here I'm talking about the decision to feature games on a
Youtube channel exclusively in return for a share of the sales profits
for some time during or following the arrangement.  I'm not talking
about [[http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/17/5911947/yogventures-kickstarter-canceled-yogscast-no-obligation][the Yogventures kickstarter fiasco]].

* Displaying an arbitrary number of objects in an arc

Want to go around in a circle, like the numbers 8-4 around the top of
a clock.  Since we have nine reasonable positions, calculate the
modulo of BigBaddie level and 9 spots, then adjust the number of hits
and number of objects to display accordingly.

* The ethics of game design

- ethics

Sarang.  The name sounded familiar to me.  It's a Korean word that
means love.  Some quick googling revealed that I'd seen it recently in
a 2008 movie called Moon.  Without spoiling too much, it is the
soothing name of the moonbase in an otherwise troubling story.  The
Sarang in this story is just as troubling, if not entirely more so due
to the reality of the situation.

Maker vs consumer economies.

No right answer.  No way to make a universally regarded ethical game.
Subjective decision.  Recognize mechanics and design that may cause
issues: charging to change reward schedules, using a powerfully
addictive reward schedule and charging to maintain access to the game.
Reward schedules can be addictive and harmful.  Know methods to
mitigate: warning screen, notice to take a break, change reward
schedule on the fly to a less reinforcing schedule.

* Types of Screenshake
- Random X and Y
  - Looks sort of chaotic, not smooth
- Periodic X and Y
  - Looks kind of swirly, can become a Screenorbit if you're not
    careful.
- Perlin X and Y
  - Smoother than Random X and Y
- Restricting movement to one axis
  - Can look good if there is some component of the scene that
    dictates the movement, i.e. the collision of a ball and a wall.
- Rotating Z (about X and Y)
  - Looks tilty, can be good if there is little movement in X and Y in
    your game and you want to convey a sense of rocking or coming down
    like a see-saw.
*  Automating blog deployment with Octopress

Based on Kevin van Zonneveld's ([[https://twitter.com/kvz][@kvz]]) [[http://kvz.io/blog/2012/09/25/blog-with-octopress/][article]] on setting up Octopress,
I've adapted a =Makefile= to make building my blog easier... with
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/][make]].  The following =Makefile= allows me to build and deploy my blog
by typing =make blog= at the command prompt.

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  all: blog

  preview:
          bundle exec rake generate && bundle exec rake preview

** Additional Notes
*** rake build didn't work for me
I think this is because I haven't written any tasks that use =rake
build=.
*** Remote for the source of my blog
I push the source code of my blog to a branch named =source= rather
than =master=.

[[http://kotaku.com/how-to-balance-an-rpg-1625516832]]

Whew.  Lot of contractions in that title.  But you made it through,
most likely because you're interested in reading about FFVI.  Let me
tell you: this article by the game design forum has pretty much taken
the cake.  That's right.  All of it.

That being said, there's little more to add to the exhaustive
exploration of the elements of FFVI's design.  Instead, I'll try to do
my best to define some of the jargon the article uses.

I found the use of complicated sabermetrics-like stats a bit confusing
at first. So assuming you're not some stat-crunching RPG machine, you
can refer back to the definitions here to help decipher the tricky
stats article.  It's worth saying now that if I didn't think that the
author makes a cogent and compelling argument for the value of the
stats, I wouldn't bother defining them.  I'm convinced that having a
grasp, a real gras p at a mathematical level, for the mechanics in
your game can make it a more compelling, fun play experience.  And
wading through design breakdowns liek these articles can make the math
less of a chore, especially when its written about one of the all-time
great examples from the genre.
