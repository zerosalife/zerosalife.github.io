** Some thoughts on Attack of the Friday Monsters      :review:3DS:mechanics:
categories:
- review
- 3DS
- mechanics

It's hard to say anything new about Attack of the Friday Monsters, a
game that splashed on the scene months ago.  The work of its creator
was lovingly lauded by [[https://twitter.com/rdbaaa][Ray Barnholt]]--a noted /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boku_no_Natsuyasumi][Boku no Natsuyami]]/
fanatic--in such a reverent way in his [[http://scroll.vg/issues/10][SCROLL magazine]] that it's
almost sacrilegious to try to write more.  So instead of doing a
point-by-point review, I'll mention some details that stand out to me,
personally.

I played through most of Attack of the Friday Monsters on a flight the
day after I watched Miyazaki's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrietty][Secret World of Arrietty]].  Sure one had
beautiful water colors and amazing visual tricks mimicking real
camerawork and the other used pre-rendered backgrounds with blocky
polygonal actors on the stage, but these art styles complimented one
another.  They didn't clash.

[[http:///images/aotfm.JPG][{% img center /images/aotfm.JPG 320 320 %}]]

I was struck by the ambient sounds that bring the pre-rendered
backgrounds and polygonal characters to life. The periodic train
sounds, presaging the arrival of an in-engine rendered train--sort of
quirky and quaint with today's game engines powerful enough to render
both background and foreground objects--remind me of a previous
exposure to Japanese culture: the first time I watched [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion][Neon Genesis
Evangelion]] as a teenager.  There are the ubiquitous cricket or cicada
sounds that were also present in Eva, but for me, they hearken back to
a youth spent in the rural South.  The drone of cicadas in the sticky
summer heat reminds me of falling asleep in a Mississippi home, of
walking into cool woods after standing in a sunny meadow.

The whole game engine is full of quirks and reminders of the PS1 era
of gaming.  But one of the mechanics seems rather novel, an addition
seemingly for its own sake, with little influence on actual plot or
gameplay.  I'm talking about the spell casting mechanic, reminiscent
of games children used to play in 70s Japan, the time in which Attack
of the Friday Monsters takes place.

If you win the sometimes annoying, somewhat forgettable,
rock-paper-scissors card game, fueled by collectibles strewn
throughout the world, you gain the ability to cast spells on your
buddies, knocking them down.  It has no bearing on the outcome of the
story.  The spell system is simply decoration that deepens the story
by providing a more complete world, accurately capturing what it feels
like to grow up as a child in Japan during the 70s.

You are allowed to pick, and reorder, the phrases of the spell your
character speaks.  This type of cosmetic customization is typical in
modern games, and in Attack of the Friday Monsters it's nothing more
than cosmetic, but it could have been used in surprising ways.

I realized the potential depth of this mechanic during a phone
conversation with my brother. As I told him about the spell casting,
he mentioned a Kickstarted pen and paper RPG called [[http://www.magiciansrpg.com/][Magicians]].
Magicians uses spells spoken in another language as both an impulse
toward learning the language and a mechanic for determining the
success or failure of an action. The game my brother described
involved a Harry Potter-esque international school for magicians in
Korea.

To use magic, the characters, and thus the players, have to correctly
speak Korean words--at least accurately enough to satisfy the
voice-recognition system of an online translation service.  This sets
up the potential for a rather clever scenario in which characters'
/[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]]/ stories are echoed by the players' acquisition of the
language.

At present, on the 3DS, the kind of voice recognition required for
this sort of is [[http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/997781-/58911600][immature]].  But it's certainly possible on more
powerful platforms.

One way to exploit the 3DS, and other devices with touch interfaces,
involves learning written language, such as Japanese /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana][hiragana]]/ or
/[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana][katakana/]].  I can imagine a magic mechanic that involves correctly
writing scrolls, where the fidelity of the player's calligraphic
strokes determines the strength and efficacy of the scrolls.

Another possible approach is to build up language comprehension by
constructing words out of syllables.  Given several options, one would
choose the correct syllable to complete the necessary word, in order
to perform an action or cast a spell.  A similar sort of approach
would work for learning syntax, completing or building a sentence with
the appropriate words.

Attack of the Friday Monsters is a quick experience, but the depth of
its design has made it a memorable one.  If you'd like to learn more
about the game and its creator, you can check out [[http://scroll.vg/extras/summer-vacation-confidential/#a][this interview]] by
Ray Barnholt, which covers Attack of the Friday Monsters and other

[[http://meatfighter.com/][MeatFighter.com]].  The article reverse engineers the inner-workings of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#NES][NES Tetris]].  With great visual aids, the author, [o__1] [1], surveys
the mechanics and data structures used to implement Tetris on the NES.
Then o__1 designs and implements an AI script to play Tetris with
super-human speed and precision.  o__1 even describes how to try it at

I hope to see more articles looking back on classic games with this
tremendous attention to detail.  An older [[http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html][article looking at Pac-man

our appreciation of these games as works of art by documenting the
essential technical complexities underlying these games.  I think
that's a good thing for everyone from hobby developers to professional
developers, as well as designers and fans.

{% img center https://github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf/blob/master/screenshot.png %}

Here's a WIP FlappyBird-like game prototype for [[http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam][#flappyjam]]: [[https://github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf][Bunnies
Don't Surf]].  You are an unfortunate rabbit whose warren is being
flooded by a passing thunderstorm.  You have to navigate the
tunnels of the warren, propelled by the wave of water flooding
your home.  There's only one problem: Bunnies Don't Surf.  So you're
stuck hopping up and down in a futile attempt to survive.

Bunnies Don't Surf requires [[http://www.python.org/][Python]] and [[http://pygame.org/news.html][pygame]] ([[http://pygame.org/download.shtml][version 1.9.1]]) to play.

Tap =space= to hop. That's about all there is to say about the
controls.

As I'm sure you can see, the game is in dire need of art assets, sound
assets, and some sort of high score system.  I'll do my best to add
these, once time allows. If anyone has feedback or art design ideas,
please let me know in the comments section or on Twitter.  I'd love to
hear it.

I'll post updates as the game progresses, and officially submit it to
#flappyjam  if it's done before the jam ends on February 24.

** What's in a name?
Growing up, the seemingly interminable school-week gave way to an
anxious car drive home from the rental store with the weekend's score.
You remember those, right?

Usually the rental would include the instruction manual.  On the ride
home, I'd pour over the manual, trying to glean useful information to
supplement my Nintendo Power-fueled strategies to maximize my fun in
the limited time I had with the game.  Often I'd get so engrossed with
the manual, learning the universe for the game, I'd let my brother or
a friend play the game first.

The looming question, not covered in the manual, was always: When will
my turn end?  When will my brother run out of lives, so I can get a
turn?

We developed a vocabulary to deal with the count down to game over. On
your first play-through it was unclear whether the last life was when
your stock counter read 1 or 0.  If you had one life left, you could
play extra hard, using a rush of adrenaline to try to stay alive
longer.

Sometimes, it was game over when the stock counter ticked over from 1
to 0.  In other games, when the stock counter reads 0, zero is a life.

The name of this blog comes from that reassuring sense that you have
an extra chance.  "Don't worry, zero's a life."

** Setting up Emacs-like key bindings in MonoDevelop
Categories:
- tools

I'm playing around with Unity to try to learn how it works.  Shout out
to Infinite Ammo for the excellent video tutorials. Since I don't know
much about Unity, I'm reluctantly using their included MonoDevelop
IDE.  While I heard that Emacs-like key bindings were included, in the
build I installed they weren't present.

MonoDevelop does not make it easy to import new key binding schemes
(the blog post linked here suggests submitting a bug report to suggest
new key bindings...).  So, I did a little digging around on github and
found the [[https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/master/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/options/KeyBindingSchemeEmacs.xml][default emacs key binding scheme]] that I imagine should have
been included in the MonoDevelop build I installed.

There was no way to add this key binding scheme to my available key
bindings in MonoDevelop, so I hacked my Custom key binding file
located at =~/Library/MonoDevelop-Unity-4.0/KeyBindings/Custom.mac-kb.xml=.

I started with some simple copypasta.  But then I found some useful
navigation features were lacking.  So, I added key binds that
immediately came to mind, like =Alt-f= for moving forward one word and
=Alt-b= for backward word.  Yes, I know these are =M-f= in Emacs, but
I'm using MonoDevelop's syntax here.

My key bindings are available in the gist below.  I'll update this
gist when I add key bindings, to keep a current working version
available.

** Cut it all right in two: bisect to find bugs
- algorithm
- tools

Imagine there's a lion in a desert.  You need to cage the lion or you
will be eaten.  In this example the desert is your code and the lion
is a bug that you're having a hard time pinning down.

There are many ways to trap a lion.  Here's one.

Build a fence dividing the desert in half going North to South.
Assuming the lion is not in the South section, divide the North
section in half with a fence going East to West.  Repeat the process
until your fence is arbitrarily small and has become a cage trapping
the lion.

But how does this relate to code?

Say you have a relatively large file that executes fine, but
introduces a bug into your larger system.  You suspect that something
has gone wrong with the large file, but you're not getting an error
implicating a specific line.

Cut it all right in two.

Comment out half the code in your large file and try to reproduce the
bug.  If you reproduce the bug, repeat the process as necessary until
you isolate the line producing the problem.

I learned about this approach for bugsleuthing from the [[https://gist.github.com/stardiviner/8109774#file-temp-txt-L26][bot in #emacs
on freenode]].  It's particularly useful for tracking down bugs in large
configuration files.  There's a list of humorous lion-trapping
algorithm examples [[http://faculty.smu.edu/yzhou/humor/lion.htm][here]].
** Upgrading to Mavericks

This week I upgraded to [[https://www.apple.com/osx/][Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks]].  To keep [[http://octopress.org/][octopress]]
working, I had to uninstall and reinstall [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/][Ruby]].

Upon trying a =rake generate= task, I saw errors in the Ruby gems for
processing [[http://www.yaml.org/][YAML]].  I assume this is due to the fact that I built them
on the older OS X install.

Interestingly, [[https://rvm.io/][RVM]] survived the upgrade and seems to be working just
fine.

I followed the instructions [[https://gist.github.com/imathis/1104557][here]] to uninstall and reinstall Ruby, the
bundler, and all bundled gems for my octopress install.  The
instructions mention a specific problem for OS X Lion, but these steps
solved the problem for me.

** The Fate of Adventure Games

Zoyə Street wrote a [[https://medium.com/p/3e3c1e20cfd0][summary]] of an interesting [[http://www.omnsh.org/ressources/527/histoire-formelle-du-jeu-daventure-sur-ordinateur-le-cas-de-lamerique-du-nord-de-1976][PhD thesis by Jonathan
Lessard]].  Lessard examines the history of adventure games, to see
whence they've come and where they've gone.  Like Street, I think this
approach to thinking about video game design and genre provides useful
perspective.

Lessard concludes that the adventure game genre didn't vanish, it
sublimated into, and was subsumed by, other modern multi-genre
games.

For example, consider 3d RPGs incorporating first-person shooter
perspective and playstyle.  I could be describing Skyrim or Titanfall,
two dramatically different games.

Lessard and Street argue, convincingly, that these sorts of games have
all the hallmarks of adventure games, while evolving new forms and
structures of play.

And now for something completely different: a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators][markov chain text

a corpus of Bangsian fantasy novels.  Its name comes from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrick_Bangs][John
Kendrick Bangs]]' novel /[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House-Boat_on_the_Styx][A House-boat on the Styx]]/ and the general
[[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks][twitter ebooks meme]].

I forked it from an earlier project by [[https://github.com/jiko][@jiko]], [[https://github.com/jiko/lovecraft_ebooks][lovecraft_ebooks]].  There
were some minor implementation hurdles, mainly related to Twitter's
API and oauth.  Reading the [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter][python =twitter= package]] =twitter.oauth=
docstring set me straight.  You can check out the code in [[https://github.com/zerosalife/styx_ebooks][my fork on
github]].

This sort of text generation algorithm isn't just useful for making
annoying twitter bots.  You could alter some of the in-game text or
dialog based on a corpus fed into a markov chain text generator.
Especially in the case of a Lovecraftian horror game, I can see how
this text could serve a thematic purpose in the story.

Say you've got a Lovecraftian horror game in which the player is an
investigator who is trying to figure out what is happening to citizens
of Innsmouth.  By interacting with NPCs, the player encounters hand
written dialog, with occasional markov-generated gibberish thrown in.
The amount of gibberish depends on how corrupted the individual
denizens of Innsmouth are becoming.  If the player is not clever
enough to determine who is corrupt, the player will be killed.  If the
player determines the source of the corruption, the player wins.

Along the same line of reasoning, the concept I'm describing here
mimics the game [[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905][ALZ]], a touching short, playable in 2 or 3 minutes,
which uses glitchy graphics to convey a sense of what it's like to
live with Alzheimer's disease to the player.  I came across Dylan
Carter's ALZ in a [[http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/making-alz-glitch-fueled-game-alzheimers/][post on the ANIMAL blog]].  This approach of literally
altering the player's experience of the game world to mimic the
subjective experience of characters in the game is ripe for
exploration.  I'd love to hear about more examples.

** Clojure Rhizome Labeled Edge Tutorial
- algorithm
- tutorial
- design
- tools
- Clojure

I'm using the [[https://github.com/ztellman/rhizome][Rhizome package]] for Clojure to rapidly prototype the
dependency graph for a crafting system.  It's nice to be able to add
and remove components while generating visualizations on-the-fly.
Clojure's simple, composable syntax, aided by paredit, makes shuffling
around key-value pairs, and even whole dictionaries, quick and easy.

The existing Rhizome documentation shows simple examples for labeling
the nodes of a directed graph.  In order to show the relationship
between nodes on the graph, I'd like to also label the edges, or the
arrows connecting the nodes.

Rhizome provides a keyword argument =:edge->descriptor= to most of its
functions.  Consulting the source code and the tests for the Rhizome
package, I learned that the functions expect =:edge->descriptor= to be
a function accepting two arguments for each edge: =src=, the source
node, and =dst=, the destination node.  In order to label the edges,
the anonymous function I'm binding to =:edge->descriptor= will return
a dictionary containing the key =:label= and the value for the edge's
label.

Here's an example using the simple graph from the Rhizome
documentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (use 'rhizome.viz)

  (def g
      {:a [:b :c]
       :b [:c]
       :c [:a]})

  (view-graph (keys g) g
              :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label n}))

#+END_SRC

{% img graph-unlabeled-edges.png %}

Now, I'll use a dictionary of dictionaries to associate the source and
destination nodes with a label for each edge.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def g-edges
    {:a {:b :makes
         :c :takes}
     :b {:c :takes}
     :c {:a :makes}})

  (view-graph (keys g) g
              :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label n})
              :edge->descriptor (fn [src dst] {:label (dst (src g-edges))}))

#+END_SRC

{% img graph-labeled-edges.png %}

I've submitted a [[https://github.com/ztellman/rhizome/pull/8][pull request]] to Rhizome to add this example to the
documentation.

** Why are caves central to so many games?
My 2¢ in response to @psysal's question: Why are caves central to so
many games?
- design


On twitter, [[https://twitter.com/psysal][@psysal]] posed this question to the game dev community:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/psysal/statuses/456314611428372480 %}

You can see all the responses by following the link to the original
tweet.

The consensus is that caves are essential features for games for three
reasons.

1) Linearity
2) Repeatability of composition
3) Curiosity

<!--more-->

*** Caves are linear

In terms of their schematic representation in the design of a game,
caves can boil down to one enclosed 'area' or room with a single
entrance.  This doesn't account for some of the amazing environments
in intricately designed games like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid][Super Metroid]], recently broken down
by [[https://twitter.com/gamespite][@gamespite]] in [[http://www.anatomyofgames.com/2013/12/08/the-anatomy-of-super-metroid-01-moving-pictures/][the Anatomy of Games series]].

But, at the most basic level, a cave must have a mouth, or an
entrance, and at least one room.  This simplifies the representation
of the critical path of play, because once the cave has been fully
explored there are no possible branches that the player could have
taken to leave the cave.  The single entrance is also a single exit.
Even if there are many internal rooms, this representation holds true,
as long as there are ultimately no 'back doors' out of the cave.

The designer can rely on the fact that once the player has received
any rewards for exploring the cave, the player can reasonably be
expected to pop out of the entrance of the cave looking for the next
available challenge surmountable with any freshly acquired toys.

*** Caves offer repeatable composition

For whatever atavistic significance they hold in our psyches, caves do
not have to rely on realistic representations in game design.  Any old
hole in some rock will almost invariably create a believable sense of
cave-ness.  Yeah, I said cave-ness. You know cave-ocity, general
cave-itude.

Since we don't spend much time in caves, day-to-day, we don't hold
them to the same level of fidelity to which we would hold, say,
buildings or automobiles.  The same architectural details necessary to
represent a house in a video game can be painted in broad strokes to
represent a cave.

In tile-based games, this means that a designer can reuse tiles over
and over again to craft a general shape without worrying too much
about players noticing, or being bothered by, the similarities.  Caves
are thus more defined by the space created rather than the graphics
used to define them.  This sense of space is what drives the third
essential feature of caves in game design, a sense of curiosity, the
drive to explore.

*** Caves are inherently curious

I'm not sure I buy the argument that we have some evolutionary
instinct that drives us to explore caves, but the fact remains.
Something about caves begs exploration.

Call it the /Will to Spelunk/.

Once a space has been created, the player wants to explore every nook
and cranny for collectible power ups or items.  Certainly the rewards
are powerful motivators.  But there is something to the exploration
for exploration's sake.  Simply completing one's mental map of the
space becomes a goal in itself.

*** Coda

It's intriguing that caves are such a fixture in the established
vocabulary of game design.  The three features highlighted in this
post make it clear that caves remain a useful game design pattern
because they serve an essential purpose in the ludic lexicon of games.

** Follow-up to the centrality of caves
- design


My [[/blog/2014/05/03/why-are-caves-central-to-so-many-games/][post last week]] about caves struck a nerve.  I received a lot of
encouraging retweets and favorites.  I also received some great
feedback.

Paul Diaz points out one design constraint granted by caves that I
hadn't considered.

{% tweet https://twitter.com/sleepytearyeyed/status/462624220447391744 %}

I think Paul is right, that this falls within the scope of caves'
linearity.  I've been thinking a bit about a possible taxonomy of cave
environments in games, but for the purposes of these posts I'll keep
it more general.  A cave is a cave, right?  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it][We know it when we see
it.]]

Any old screen in a game can be cave-like in the way its environmental
design constraints fit into the game world.  Here I'm using 'screen'
to refer to a room in a metroid-like game or a level in other sorts of
games--some arbitrary atomic unit of division of the game environment
constituting a discrete area.

For the purpose of argument, Paul's point forces us to think of the
most cave-y of caves, which I think was the intent behind the original
question in the first place.  Because caves are dark environments,
dank environments, /interior/ environments, they lack the uniform
lighting that typically characterizes the exterior 'overworld' in
games.  As Paul states, lighting cues can serve as guideposts for the
player, directing attention toward the critical path.

I view this example as a manifestation of the fundamental reduction in
degrees of freedom of play achieved by the interiority, and thus,
linearity of caves.  The fact that there are more walls, and therefore
fewer possible places for the player to go, allows for the designer,
using careful construction, to communicate intent to the player
through the environment itself.  I don't mean to say here that such
communication is impossible outside of caves, just that caves are one
simple and straightforward way to achieve this constrained,
communicative sort of design.  This vocabulary of design showed up
early on in the history of games, it worked, and it has persisted.

** Quarries of Scred Roadmap
[[http://www.indiedb.com/games/quarries-of-scred/news/quarries-of-scred-rolling-down-the-roadmap]]

The [[http://darkestkale.itch.io/quarries-of-scred][Quarries of Scred]] [[https://twitter.com/darkestkale][developer]] released an image showing the overview
of Scred's 14-day game development.  I find it informative for a
couple of reasons.  First it's not limited to the core features of the
game, Kale's also included public relations and marketing information.
Second, the fact that it's incomplete shows how Kale's prioritized
critical elements of the game.

Rather than blatantly stealing the [[http://www.indiedb.com/games/quarries-of-scred/images/quarries-of-scred-roadmap-2013-11-28-01][roadmap for Quarries of Scred]], I'll
give you a few seconds to go and capture an eidetic mental image.  Got
it?  Great.  I guess all you cheaters who opened it another tab can
follow along too.

<!--more-->

*** Core Gameplay
Looking at the presumably completed 'green light' items, Core Gameplay
is almost finished.  And it should be.  Without Core Gameplay, there's
not much game to be played.

It looks like they have not included actual aspects of the core
mechanic implementation on this roadmap.  However, they're using the
roadmap as a method of cataloging oft-overlooked features that add
polish to the final game.

They have a milestone for implementing a persistent high score system.
This hurdle is easy to imagine, since we see it in almost every game
we play.  But it can be tricky to implement in a robust and efficient
manner.

Several elements of UI are included on the roadmap.  They could be
neglected in a prototype, these UI elements can make a finished game
welcoming for new players and compelling enough to replay.  Info
screens can clarify the world for tyros and explicitly show unique
challenge states to experienced players.  Death information, like
gravestones in Nethack, provides potentially entertaining feedback for
the players attempting to hone their skills at the game.

I'm not sure whether they finished implementing rocket ship building
gameplay in Quarries of Scred, but this should be a goal for every
game.

*** PR
Marketing is an aspect of game development that is easy to overlook as
an inexperienced indie or hobby gamedev with a few gamejams under your
belt.  The pressure to simply finish a game, any shippable game,
overshadows what to do with it once it's released.

Setting up an IndieDB page to track the progress is a great idea.
And, since it doesn't necessarily require a finished product, it can
be done early on in the development process.  The priorities of
creating an IndieDB Icon, Header Image, and Preview Image show Kale's
clearly interested in branding Scred as a marketable indie title.

I can confirm that a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBrZ_POiKJO4][Trailer]], [[http://darkestkale.itch.io/quarries-of-scred][Website]], and [[http://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvODc0LzQ0MTIucG5n/original/Npan5L.png][Box Art]] came along in due
time.  The inclusion of Box Art in a download only indie title is
particularly charming, even in an atmosphere awash with these things,
the art for Scred's box is fun and quaint, in a good way.

*** Further Content
Further Content looks like features that would directly build on those
already implemented in the game.  Rather than being classified as
Fluff, these extra features would complement the content and features
already implemented in the game.

It's important to have the courage to 'kill your darlings' in cases
like this.  Some of the items under Fluff like pretty important to
making a good game, but if they are too demanding to fit in the
schedule allotted to create the game, they have to go.

One of the buildings has made it in.  And I think the second building
is in the final game. Not sure whether the Rare Flower survived.

*** Bookending
The Bookending category looks like a lot of the UI improvements I
talked about above.  They certainly improve players' experience, but
they may not be absolutely necessary to get the game out the door.

I can only speculate that configurable keys are highlighted in gray
because it would be silly not to include them.  For that matter,
everything except troubleshooting info adds delicious spice to the
well-seasoned dish that the Core Gameplay milestones create.

*** Fluff
It looks like the Fluff category represents additional features that
aren't required to make a working game.  The ability to select a seed
is probably a new system that requires designing and implementing,
much like the UI stuff in the Bookending category.  New Sprites and
Death Animation are probably a similar story.

You may argue that music and sound are critical for a completed game.
But if you are not a musically inclined person, the shear amount of
work required to get something that sounds like the death-throes of a
thousand Gameboys (note: this is not a good thing) could double your
production time.  The New Sprites mentioned in the previous paragraph
are probably a similar case of requiring too much time that could be
more productively devoted elsewhere in the project.

*** Closing Thoughts
This kind of frank openness about game design is unusual to get prior
to the publication of a game.  It's really great to see the design
documents behind a game, even if it comes out years after release.
It's especially informative to see an in-progress version where the
developer is unafraid to lay the goals out there, to show where the
project succeeds and possibly falls short.

** Introduction
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG][{% img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/ChronoTriggerInside.PNG from Wikipedia%}]]
Image from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger][wikipedia.org]].

I recently revisited [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger][Chrono Trigger]], a 20-year-old Square role playing
game (RPG) for the SNES.  I was inspired by a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DV_SFck-xeGM][speed run]] from [[http://gamesdonequick.com/][Awesome
Games Done Quick]] 2012, a charity fundraiser featuring speed runs of
old and new school games.  If [[https://twitter.com/EssentiaFour][Essentia]] could [[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ChronoTrigger.html][beat the game in 5 hours]],
surely, copying her strategies, I could finish it in a reasonable
amount of time.

In the course of my play-through I grew curious about the underlying
mechanics of the Chrono Trigger battle system.  In order to optimize
speed running strategies, Chrono Trigger's mechanics have been
scrutinized to an obsessive degree.  There are numerous guides, one of
which is [[http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger/Formulae][here]].  But, none of the guides I found could clearly identify
the mechanics behind Chrono Trigger's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation][random number generator]] (RNG).

Most likely, under the hood, the RNG is a variation of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register][linear
feedback shift register]].  I recently came across a similar RNG in an
[[http://meatfighter.com/nintendotetrisai/#Picking_Tetriminos][in-depth article about the mechanics of NES Tetris]]. But I'm not
concerned with how the programmers implemented a good RNG.  I'm
concerned with the rules governing how that RNG interacts with the
battle system.

I'm gonna get a little pedantic here, bear with me. In an RPG combat
system, the RNG introduces an element of luck, which makes battles
more interesting and potentially ruining speed runs if not properly
understood.  The speed runners apparently compensate for any
variability of the RNG, but its mechanics have not been laid out.  So
I set out to investigate the mechanics of the RNG in Chrono Trigger,
using basic R commands to tease apart its underlying algorithms.

<!--more-->

** A brief note on the choice of R
There was no good reason to choose R for this analysis.  I chose R
because I was comfortable using it to quickly do the statistical
analyses summarizing a data set.

** Chrono Trigger's battle system

Chrono Trigger's battle system has two types of attacks: *[[http://chrono.wikia.com/wiki/Tech][Tech]]*
(including magic) and *[[http://chrono.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Chrono_Trigger_weapons][weapon attacks]]*.  The Tech system is more
complicated than the basic weapon attack system, so I'll focus on
weapon attacks for now.

Crono's basic weapon attacks use the formula:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Attack = ((Power * 4/3) + (Weapon * 5/9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some of the other characters' attacks use different formulas.  For the
sake of simplicity, I'm going to focus my analysis on Crono.

The parameters *Power (PWR)* and *Weapon* determine the base
amount of damage dealt when a weapon hits, using the formula:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Damage  = ((Attack * 2) + (Random))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the base damage Crono can deal, assuming *Random* is 0, is his
double *Attack* value.  This gives us a stable mark to observe the
variability of the RNG.

How is the random number determined?  To answer that question, I
set out to carefully analyze empirical data, accounting for the known
parameters of the *Damage* formula.  That's a fancy way of saying, I
hit the same enemies with the same weapons a bunch of times.  I kept
track of the damage dealt each time.

** Analysis and Observations
Crono begins the game with 5 *PWR* and his weapon is a Wood Sword,
which has a *Weapon* value of 3. Crono's *Attack* value is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Attack = ((5 * 4/3) + (3 * 5/9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So his *Attack* is 8⅓, which is rounded down to 8.  I think the
rounding down is equivalent to a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions][=floor= function]] because, in cases
where the calculated *Attack* value would have a fractional component
above half, the game always rounds down.

I store Crono's *Attack* power in a variable called =apwr=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  c.apwr <- 8

#+END_SRC

That means his base damage per hit is double that:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  calculated.hit <- 16

#+END_SRC

Now we observe a bunch of hits using these parameters.  This is no
simple task because Crono levels up after a few battles, changing the
value of his *Attack* parameter.  I kept the values consistent by
reloading, starting from scratch, each time Crono leveled up.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  ## Crono Level 1, Attack Power 8
  raw.hits <- c(32, 17, 16, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 32, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16,
                17, 32, 32, 17, 16, 17, 17, 16, 16, 17, 16, 34, 16, 17,
                16, 17, 16, 17, 16)

#+END_SRC

Here we've got a collection that samples 33 hits by Crono at level 1.

We can get summary statistics:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  summary(raw.hits)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> summary(raw.hits)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  16.00   16.00   17.00   18.97   17.00   34.00
#+END_EXAMPLE

So, the majority of hits did 16 or 17 damage.  A few were much higher
than that.  The hits doing 32 or 34 damage represent critical hits,
which I failed to realize, would contaminate my data set.  Critical
hits simply deal double damage, a fact you can see by the lack of hits
dealing 33 damage.

A critical hit dealing 33 damage would require raw damage of 16.5,
which would require representing floating point numbers.  Given what
we previously observed about the *Attack* calculation above, it should
come as no surprise that Chrono Trigger's battle system uses integers
only.

We'll ignore critical hits for now.

Crono's calculated damage value is 16.  We see that the hits vary
between 16 and 17.  So the added *Random* modifier is either 0 or 1.

The modifiers occur with about the same frequency, given the tiny sample
size:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session
  table(raw.hits)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
> table(raw.hits)
raw.hits
16 17 32 34
12 16  4  1
#+END_EXAMPLE



** Summary

There are still questions that remain unanswered.

What RNG parameters govern levels 2 and 3?

Is the RNG governing the Tech system similar?

How does evasion work?  I haven't seen much information about missed hits.

Can I provide a concrete example of the *Attack* value rounding down
when its fractional value would be calculated to be above ½?

All told, it took me a little North of 12 hours to beat the game,
using Essentia's strategies.  I'm no speed runner.

Potential for platforms to become involved prior to release, free
advertising for devs and possible for platform owners to sell ads.  As
it stands, may make more money from straight-up advertising splits
with existing streaming platforms, but no pre-order it now button
incorporated with system.  Potential for more sales may outweigh
advertising revenue for devs.

I've noticed a trend toward livestreaming development emerging among
projects I follow on twitter. This is not because I'm particularly
observant.  It's obvious.

Devs will announce on twitter that they are going to develop for a few
hours, often working on a specific system or feature.  This is a
win-win situation because interested parties can watch and interact
with the dev; and because the developer is held accountable to work,
without goofing off on twitter, while simultaneously marketing to the
core audience.  There are, of course, costs, and the gamasutra article
by Brandon Sheffield does a good job pointing these out.

Of course, broadcasting video gameplay in the form of Let's Plays has
already skyrocketed in terms of viewership and monetization since 2009
(?).  The recent acquisition of Twitch, a popular livestreaming
platform, by YouTube for $1 billion clearly demonstrates the [[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/with-twitch-acquisition-talks-validation-of-games-as-spectator-sport/][value of
broadcasting games]].

Livestreaming has already caught on as a form a interactive content
production, the very production of which can itself be monetized.
Monetization, as such, is not always a selfish thing. Greed is good,
when that greed is directed toward leveraging these interactive
streaming platforms to raise funds for charity, as in the case of
Games Done Quick, Yogscast Christmas Drives, Desert Bus, and the Mario
Marathon.  These streamed charity events, and even non-charity
streams, can themselves then be edited, chopped & screwed into content
for the streamers normal non-streaming content delivery platform.

* Creating a Dictionary of Lists in Unity JavaScript
- JavaScript
- Unity
- tools
- algorithms

I ran into a few problems trying to create a [[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_Dictionary][Dictionary]] of [[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_List][Lists]] in
Unity JavaScript.  So I thought I'd share some of the tips I learned
here.

I'm interested in creating a Dictionary to hold Markov Chain
information to generate text.  So I'd like to be able to create a
Dictionary holding a variable length of items for each of its Keys.
I'd also like to be able to update the mapping at runtime.

It would look something like this:
- Key1 :: Item1, Item2, Item3
- Key2 :: Item4

At runtime, I'd like to be able to say: "Append =Item5= to =Key2=."

Here's what I came up with in Unity JavaScript.  I started out by
initializing a =table= in my script prior to the =Start= function. The
var =table= holds our mapping of Keys of type =String= to Values of
type =List.<int>=, or Lists of integers.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:3
  import System.Collections.Generic;
  // White space matters.
  var table:Dictionary.<String,List.<int> > = new Dictionary.<String,List.<int> >();
#+END_SRC

The first hiccup I ran into is that [[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/80227-Creating-a-Dictionary-of-Lists-in-Javascript?p%3D513471&viewfull%3D1#post513471][white space matters]], when creating
Generics in Unity JavaScript.  The compiler will throw an error if it
sees two =>>= in a row.

Then I fill the table with our test mappings.


#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:9
  // Fill our table with Lists containing ints using Arrays to intialize
  // the Lists.
  table["a"] = new List.<int>([1]);
  table["b"] = new List.<int>([2]);
  table["c"] = new List.<int>([3]);

#+END_SRC


As you can see, you can [[http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/221476/javascript-array-to-generic-list.html][construct a List from an Array]].  Cool.

In the =Start= function, I iterate over the Keys in the Dictionary,
Add the item =4= to the Value of Key =c=, and print out the first item
of each of the Values.  Finally, we check to see whether =4= was
appended to the desired entry.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:13
function Start () {
    // Iterate over the Keys in our Dictionary.
    for(var str:String in table.Keys) {
        // Get the value for our Key.
        var value:List.<int> = table[str];

        // If the Key is our desired Key, append to its list.
        if (str == "c") {
            value.Add(4);
        }

        // Print the first item in each of the Lists.
        print(value[0]);
    }

    // Print the appended item to see that it worked.
    print(table["c"][1]);

}
#+END_SRC

Then I attach this script to the Main Camera for testing purposes.
Bada bing, bada boom.

This was all relatively straightforward, after I understood some of
the quirks of Unity's JavaScript syntax.  On my github account, you
can find a repository of an example Unity project using this code
here.

* Probabilistic Entity Spawning in Unity JavaScript
- JavaScript
- Unity
- tools
- algorithms

The Unity documentation has an example showing how to generate random
indexes satisfying a distribution of probabilities.  In this post I'll
show you how to use a similar approach to generate random items with
specific probabilities dictated by the environment.

I want to be able to generate an item code, say =Red=, =Green=, or
=Black=, given a list of floating point probabilities dictated by the
current area, for example =desert= or =grassland=.

Varying the probability of encountering items will give each area a
unique flavor.  If the player needs a =Red= item, the player will need
to seek out areas in which the probability for encountering =Red=
items is high.  I hope this will drive player exploration and
investigation.

I'll start by defining an array of possible item types.  (According to
[[http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Head_First_into_Unity_with_UnityScript#Use_enum][this introduction to Unity JavaScript]], I should prefer =enum=.)

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:5
  var ents : String[] = ["Red", "Green", "Black", "Orange"];
#+END_SRC

Then I define a Dictionary =areas= of Lists of floating point
probabilities.  These areas correspond to terrains that contain unique
distributions of items. The =areas= Dictionary accepts =strings=
specifying the desired terrain.

It's important to note that the order of the probabilities correspond
to the order of the item types in =ents=.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:7
  var areas = new Dictionary.<String, List.<float> >();
  areas["desert"] = new List.<float>([0.1, 0.05, 0.425, 0.425]);
  areas["grassland"] = new List.<float>([0.3, 0.35, 0.1, 0.25]);
#+END_SRC

So, in the =grassland= area, there will be a 30% chance of choosing a
=Red= item.

Now that we've defined our data, we need a function to choose the
appropriate index given a List of probabilities.  This function is
lifted with minor modifications from the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html][Unity Documentation]].

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:11
  function Choose(probs : List.<float>) : int {
      // Returns the index of a probabilistically determined random
      // entity, given by the probability distributions in probs.
      // e.g.:
      // probs : List.<float>([0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2]);
      // entity = entities[Choose(probs)];
      //
      // See [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html]]

      // Watch out!  If you fail to specify total's type as float, it
      // will add the probs using integer addition.  This will floor
      // each of the probs to 0.
      var total : float = 0;

      for (x in probs) {
          total += x;
      }

      var randomPoint = Random.value * total;

      for(var i = 0; i < probs.Count; i++) {
          if (randomPoint < probs[i])
              return i;
          else
              // Shift the strip down, adjusting the random point's
              // value to see whether it falls within the next prob.
              randomPoint -= probs[i];
      }
      // Take care of possibility that randomPoint is 1.0 or 100% by
      // returning the last element of probs.  Avoids allowing Choose to
      // return a 0 probability event (which would be possible using the
      // <= test).
      return probs.Count - 1;

  }
#+END_SRC

Now to choose an item:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript start:48
  var item = ents[Choose(areas["grassland"])];
  Debug.Log(item);
#+END_SRC

That's all there is to it. I've put an example Unity project with this
code on github.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

We believe that most value in the world comes through sharing, and
that music is no exception. One of the benefits of sharing is that it
makes learning much easier. For example, we often hear amazing sounds
on albums and wonder how they were made. However, musicians rarely
share their production methods. We release all the software we write,
which includes our synthesiser designs, interaction abstractions, and
compositional structures, under an open source license, and we
distribute it to everyone through GitHub. This makes it free and easy
for anybody to copy and recreate any aspect of our work. For example,
when one of our fans is interested in the sound of one of the synths
we're using, they can go to GitHub and download the synth design as
text. They can email it to their friends, read it, study it, copy it,
modify it and run it to recreate the exact sound.

[[http://csharptutorial.blogspot.com/2006/05/question-mark-ternary-operator.html]]

I ported a cool toy from [[http://alastaira.wordpress.com/2014/03/15/a-simple-mind-reading-machine/][Alastair Atchison's blog]] to Unity
JavaScript.  The toy implements a simple 'mind-reading' algorithm that
attempts to guess whether the player will choose Left (by pressing the
left arrow key) or Right (by pressing the right arrow key).

<!--more-->

** How does it work?

Atchison's blog post describes how it works:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How does it work? Not by mind-reading, obviously, but by exploiting
the fact that humans do not behave as "randomly" as they think they
do. The computer maintains a very simple memory that records the
pattern of results of the last two rounds – whether the player won or
lost, whether they switched strategy, and then whether they then won
or last the following round. The computer then uses this to choose its
own best strategy based on the way the player behaved last time the
current pattern occurred. If the computer loses twice in a row using
the current strategy, it picks a random response in the next round.
#+END_QUOTE

The original idea came from some AI work by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon][Claude Shannon]]
and D. W. Hagelbarger.  [[http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/ai.html][They describe the internal memory of the toy
mind-reader]] that we will model using a multidimensional array =v=:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are 8 possible situations and two things the player can do at each one:

1) player wins, plays same, wins. Then same or differently.
2) player wins, plays same, loses. Then same or differently.
3) player wins, plays differently, wins. Then same or differently.
4) player wins, plays differently, loses.Then same or differently.
5) player loses, plays same, wins.Then same or differently.
6) player loses, plays same, loses.Then same or differently.
7) player loses, plays differently, wins.Then same or differently.
8) player loses, plays differently, loses.Then same or differently.
#+END_QUOTE

** Why port it?
Why not just take a straightforward approach, running
his code myself? First, I wanted to fully understand the algorithm the
hard way, by coding it line for line myself. And second, I wanted to
better familiarize myself with Unity JavaScript, including its
differences from C#.

The port was relatively simple, except for two small hiccups.  First,
as far as I know, Unity JavaScript doesn't allow for initializing a
multidimensional array.  So I looped over the cells in the array,
filling them that way.  I have a hunch that the cells are initialized
to the =int= =0= by default, but I wanted to be explicit.  Please let
me know in the comments or [[https://twitter.com/zerosalife][via twitter]] if I'm way off base.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  var v : int[2, 2, 2];
  for(var cell in v) {
      cell = 0;
  }

#+END_SRC

I also encountered some unfamiliar syntax: the sonorously named Elvis
operator, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_operator][?:]].  It's also called the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation][ternary operator]], when it's used
with 3 arguments, as I've used it here.  In C-like languages it allows
for succinctly stating these kinds of conditional expressions. The
example below illustrates how it's used.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  // Is the current player's choice the same as the previous player's
  // choice?
  //
  // if (playerChoice == lastChoice)
  //     sameChoice = True;
  // else
  //     sameChoice = False;
  //
  // Using ternary operator:
  v[lw2, lw1, 1] = (v[lw2, lw1, 0] == playerChoice ? 1 : 0);

* Mobile Frame Football Association
** Football games
*** Duration of play
Mobile Frame Football Association (MFFA) sanctioned games last 12
turns, consisting of two equal 6-turn halves.  MFFA rules do not allow
for the countdown mechanic from the vanilla Mobile Frame Zero (MF0)
rules.

*** Objective
When time expires, the player with the highest number of goals scored
wins.

*** Teams
Games are played between teams consisting of equal numbers of frames.
Frames may have up to 4 systems installed, with the usual vanilla MF0
benefits for fewer than 4 installed systems (see, e.g., p. 64).

*** Field of Play
The game field should be approximately the size of a normal MF0 table,
with goals the size of 1 /movement scale/ on each end of the field.
Lines should be laid out to clearly mark the in bounds/out of bounds
boundary.  There should be at least 1" of space on the sidelines, to
allow for units to be positioned outside of the field during out of
bounds situations.

The size of your available Field of Play can dictate the Movement and
Shooting Scales for your game.  The suggested defaults are based on a
normal MF0 table, your mileage may vary.

** Deployment
During the deployment phase, you may place your units anywhere on the
field in a legal formation.

*** Beginning of play
At the beginning of the game, at the beginning of the second half, or
at a kickoff following a goal, players take turns placing units in
bounds, in the half of the field that has been assigned (See:
[[*Determining%20possession][Determining possession]]).  The player in possession of the ball, the
/offensive player/, goes first.  The ball, represented by a d12, is
placed at the center of the field. The offensive player must place a
unit next to the ball, this unit is said to be in possession of the
ball.

**** Determining possession
A coin flip determines possession at the beginning of the game, with
the winning player electing to be on offense or defense first.  The
losing player gets to determine the side of the field in which to
deploy.

At the half, the possession and sides switch.  Following a scored
goal, the player who was scored on gains possession of the ball at the
kickoff.

*** After a dead ball situation
Play is stopped due to a foul, an out of bounds ball. This is called
a /dead ball/ situation.

**** Out of bounds
Out of bounds balls force a turnover of possession. The ball is placed
on the sideline where it went out of bounds.

Both players may redeploy their units, however the offensive player
may not place a unit beyond the defensive unit closest to the goal.
The defensive player places first, and must move the unit closest to
the goal first, if it will be moved in the redeployment.  Players
alternate placing units.  The offensive player must place a unit next
to the ball.

After the offensive player redeploys the last unit, play resumes with
the unit next to the ball immediately taking its turn, regardless of
its initiative roll.  If the unit next to the ball has an initiative
die, remove it.

***** Corner Kicks and Goal Kicks
Corner kicks occur when a defending unit kicks the ball out of bounds
on the sideline running on its own 'goal' side of the field.  The ball
is placed on the corner sideline on the side it went out of bounds.

Goal kicks occur when an offensive unit kicks the ball out of bounds
on the sideline of the defensive units' 'goal' side of the field.  The
ball is placed in front of the goal.

**** Fouls
Fouls do not force a turnover of possession.  Redeployment following a
foul occurs the same as in the [[*Out%20of%20bounds][Out of bounds]] situation.

**** Redeployment and units that have already taken turns
Redeployment does not normally reset whether a unit has taken its
turn.  If the unit placed next to the ball in a dead ball situation
has already taken its turn, it gets a free turn taken immediately
following deployment, when play resumes.

** Initiative
For the time being, MFFA uses the older per-unit turn order from MF0
(p. 136).  Enough with the hutching bellyaching, you yabbies.

Players roll 1d10 for each unit, placing the die next to the unit.
Initiative starts at 1 and counts up.  When you reach a unit's
initiative roll in the count, remove the initiative die next to the
unit, that unit takes its turn.

If two units have the same roll, when their number is reached, reroll
the initiative dice. Lowest roll goes first with the next highest
reroll going immediately after.  Once all of the rerolled ties have
been resolved, the initiative count continues as normal.

In a dead ball situation, the initiative count does not reset.

*** Coaching
Coaching adds a layer of complexity to initiative determination.  It
may slow down the game a bit, but it allows for extra tactical
decisions.

Coaching allows players to take control of the assignment of
initiative to each of their units.  Both players roll a number of
initiative dice equal to their units, then take turns assigning to
initiative dice to their units. The defensive player chooses first.
After initiatives are assigned, the initiative count starts and counts
up as normal.


** Dice systems
As in MF0, frames have 2 white dice representing the frame chassis
plus other dice representing up to 4 additional systems.  Frames get
the usual vanilla MF0 benefits for having fewer than 4 installed
systems (see, e.g., p. 64).

*** Red dice
Red dice represent the ability of a frame to shoot or pass the ball on
offensive.  Unlike the vanilla MF0 rules, there are two legal ranges
for red dice on offense: direct and artillery.  Systems granting hand
to hand dice are not rolled on offense.

When shooting, you must score a successful hit on the goal using the
difficulty table from MF0 to score a goal.  When passing you must
score a successful hit on your ally to successfully pass the ball. You
must declare the range you will be targeting at the beginning of your
turn.

On defense, red dice represent steals (hand to hand range) and slide
tackles (direct range).  Systems granting artillery dice are not
rolled on defense.

Red dice use a special scale that is different from the movement
scale.  See [[*Movement%20Scale%20and%20Shooting%20scale][Movement Scale and Shooting Scale]]

**** Passing and shooting
When in range for a shot or a pass, the player must roll a number of
/hit dice/ equal to the /shot value/ minus the blue /defense value/ of
any units in the line of fire.  Any units in the line of the pass or
shot act as cover, using the normal MF0 cover rules.  If there is
doubt, consult the MF0 cover rules to determine if a unit is in the
line of fire.

If the rolled hit dice successfully /score a hit/, then the ball goes
where the offensive player wants, into the goal or into the possession
of another unit.  Use Damage chart 2 from the MF0 rules (Hit target on
a 5 or 6) if there is no other unit between the shooter and the
target.  Use Damage chart 4 if there is a unit between the shooter and
the target. (Hit target on a 6)

Failure to score a hit is called a /fumble/, and causes the ball to go
wide somewhere in the range of the shot at the opposing player's
discretion (be reasonable here, it's not going to /fly backwards/).
This may cause the ball to go out of bounds, into the possession of a
unit, into the goal, or into the field of play.

**** Stealing and slide tackling
When stealing or slide tackling, /scoring a hit/ results in the ball
coming into the stealing or tackling unit's possession.  The stealing
or tackling unit's player rolls a number of /hit dice/ equal to its
red /shot value/ for the steal or tackle attack minus the blue
/defense value/ of the unit in possession of the ball.

Always use Damage chart 2 for stealing and slide tackling. On a roll
of 5 or 6, the steal or slide tackle scores a hit.

Failure to score a hit is a /fumble/.  Nothing special happens, unless
the player rolls a 1 on one of the hit dice.

Rolling a 1 on a hit die during a fumble results in a foul.  See
/Fouls/.

*** Blue Dice
Blue dice systems remain the same as blue dice systems in the normal
MF0 rules.  However, rather than representing armor, they represent
the ability of a unit to gain or maintain control of the ball.

*** Yellow Dice and Green Dice
Yellow and green dice systems remain the same as vanilla MF0.

** Taking a turn
Taking a turn begins with target declaration.  For the defensive units
this will generally be the unit in possession of the ball.  For the
offensive unit in possession of the ball, this could be targeting a
fellow offensive unit for a pass or targeting the opposing goal.

Attacks don't do anything to units without the ball.  Save that
animosity for the war.

The turn proceeds as per the vanilla MF0 rules. Any unit that would be
activated with the normal MF0 turn rules, i.e. the target of a steal
attempt or a pass, takes its turn as per those rules.

** Movement Scale and Shooting Scale

Normal vanilla MF0 scale is 2".  /Shooting scale/ for MFFA is 2".
/Movement scale/ is double that, 4", to represent the agility of these
hot-rodded sportsframes.

Using two different colored rulers (e.g., 1 red for shooting and 1
green for movement) is a good way to distinguish /movement scale/ and
/shooting scale/.

* Improvisation vs Preparation
This week I look at how games from JoshuaACNewman, handle
Improvisation vs Preparation as modes of play

Or preparation as play.

This post was inspired by hearing about long set-up times eating into
time-crunched play time for busy adults.

As young adults with minimal time commitment it was nothing to spend
hours preparing for a gaming session among friends.  There was little
concern for an hour or two spent setting up a wargaming afternoon.
But as adults these time commitments quickly eat-in to or completely
consume any time that would otherwise be spent having fun, gaming with
your friends.

Certain games lend themselves more to the /preparation/ side of things
than the /improvisation/ side.

Consider the examples I mentioned above, a gamemaster driven
roleplaying game and a tabletop war game.  Certainly these are fun
pastimes but they require preparation on the part of the individual or
all parties involved.  Roleplaying games require, at least initially,
the generation of player characters for all involved, potentially
consuming the entire first play session.  The gamemaster is required
to plot out a scenario for each play session, necessitating an
substantial noninteractive time investment outside of the normal play
session.  For war games, players must spend time constructing armies,
generally away from the normal interaction at the table.

In the thick of the actual game, both roleplaying and tabletop gaming
can be fun and improvisiational in the same way as the sorts of games
I'm calling /improvisiational/.  I don't deny that.

How does this differ from say playing stickball or baseball with your
friends in an alley or a field with just a stick and a ball?  The game
starts when the minimally necessary instruments arrive and continues
even as players come and go.  It's almost heinous to interrupt these
sorts of improvised games, hence the saying "taking the ball and going
home."

To stretch this metaphor beyond its limit: in this syllogism, the
polar opposite of pickup baseball or basketball would be ice hockey,
something requiring potentially hours of preparation by a Zambonist to
prepare the playing surface so the players can play for a relatively
short time.

Some roleplaying games provide hook generation tables.  Sometimes
rolling on random tables to generate encounters can feel like play,
but it's a relatively lifeless mechanic.

There are a few games that get preparation as play mechanics right,
but I think there is still room for improvement.

  - Shock

  - Fate Core

  - Prime Time Adventures

  - Microscope

  - How to Host a Dungeon

These games all turn the world gen and character background into an
gameplay activity, typically performed during the first group play
session.  Shock even does away with the necessity of a GM, allowing
players to take turns serving as protagonists, antagonists, or neutral
third parties.  These examples go a long way toward what I mean by
preparation as play, but I don't think they've captured it entirely.

What I'm looking for is a separate /asynchronous/ type of game, where
preparation has its own mechanics that boil down to a solo game unto
itself.  The results of the each player's solo game(s) are then
somehow incorporated and allowed to influence the collaborative group
play session.

* Nontraditional game jams

Game jams need not simply vary in terms of theme or duration.  There
are plenty of interesting axes upon which they can be projected for
new and interesting results.

** Game jam as recruitment
Game jams are typically thought of as a way for *participants* to
network.  And they are.  Game jams are unique, if not the most casual
and carefree, spaces for meeting and trial collaboration with others.

But that's not all.  You, yes I mean you, as an organizer are in a
unique position to network with talented game makers of all stripes.
Looking for pixel artists?  Organize a 48 hour game jam with pixel art
graphics as a constraint and a theme of your choice.

Yes, it could be considered manipulative, possibly unscrupulous or
unethical, but no one is twisting anyone's arm to participate.  And,
there's no reason not to be transparent when organizing the game jam.
Say you're looking for great pixel art because you would like to
collaborate on a specific idea.

There's one benefit of recruiting from willing participants in game
jams.  THese are poeple with at least enough free time to commit to
participating in a game jam.  They may be more approachable than
people who are otherwise tied up and unable to commit 24 hours, 48
hours, or a week to start and finish a project.

W.G. Armintrout made a similar plea in a Space Gamer Magizine issue
from 1982, (#52).

Imagine having to provide a questionaire with a game prototype to
solicit feedback on a design.  It may look something like this:

1. How much did you play? (approximate number of games)
2. Did you enjoy the game? If so, what made it enjoyable?
3. Was anything broken? Was anything not enjoyable, tedious, fiddly etc?
4. Were the rules/objectives understandable?
5. Any suggestions for improvement or comments?

Now imagine looking over a player's shoulder during the entire
playtesting experience.

Let's play videos and reports represent an entertaining and imminently
watchable form of playtesting.

* Terrain Vocabulary
Useful Geographical Descriptors

* Rectangles for Prototyping in Unity 2d for Dummy
- Unity
- design
- prototype

I'm the dummy.  Prototyping with 2d boxes in Unity has proven
surprisingly hard.  I think the difficulty I'm having is that I'm not
exactly sure what I'm trying to do.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability][Discoverability]] is something I prize in programming languages and
environments, especially when I'm learning them.  While Unity's
documentation is thorough, the lack of congruence between the GUI
environment and coding leads to poor discoverability.  There's not a
one-to-one correspondence between the labels for =Components= in the
GUI inspector and their names and attributes in code.

Most of the time, Google is my method for discovering new
functionality in Unity.  The problem with this method, and even the
documentation, is that I'm never quite sure if the solution I've found
is the best solution, the only way to do something, or the wrong way
to do something.

I'm trying to get simple rectangular boxes to work in Unity 2d for
prototyping movement, hitboxes for attacsk, etc.  The information I
can find either deals with real-deal-Holyfield sprites or =GUIBoxes=.
It will be nice to work with =Sprites= eventually, but I just want to
get a box that can walk around and jump, at this point.  =GUIBoxes=
seem like the wrong type of boxes, if I want to prototype something
that will eventually be a =Sprite=.


As near as I can tell, the =Sprite= is a new way of making a flat 2D
=Plane= in Unity.  I couldn't seem to find anything dealing with
=Sprites= without creating them in the Unity GUI interface.

So, I started out following a Unity Answers question [[http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/139808/creating-a-plane-mesh-directly-from-code.html][here]].

** Getting the Mesh to gel

First, I created a brand-spankin new Unity 2D project.  I had to
create an empty =GameObject= to host my =PlaneTest.js= script
=Component=.  I included a variable =size= to control the size of the
box, so you can play around with that in the Editor interface.

Next, I had to create a =Mesh= that would be the actual geometry of
the plane.  Now, the =Mesh= I'm making differs from the stock Unity
=Plane= =GameObject=.  [[http://www.third-helix.com/2012/02/making-2d-games-with-unity/][This blog post]] shows that Unity's =Plane=
defaults to a 10 x 10 quad mesh with a couple hundred triangles.  A
quad is just a square made of two triangle faces, [[http://blog.nobel-joergensen.com/2010/12/25/procedural-generated-mesh-in-unity/][this blog post]] goes
into more detail.

Here we [[http://i.eho.st/pgtxqdii.gif][do it live]] by defining a =name= =String=, an =array= of
=Vector3= =vertices=, an =array= of =uv= texture coordinates, and an
=array= of =triangles= faces.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
    var m: Mesh = new Mesh();
    m.name = "Scripted_Plane_New_Mesh";
    m.vertices = [Vector3(-size, -size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(size, -size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(size, size, 0.01),
                  Vector3(-size, size, 0.01)];
    m.uv = [Vector2(0, 0),
            Vector2(0, 1),
            Vector2(1, 1),
            Vector2(1, 0)];
    m.triangles = [0, 1, 2,
                   0, 2, 3];
#+END_SRC

** Who you calling normal?

At one point I thought I had to =RecalculateNormals=, according to the
Unity Answers example above.  But it doesn't seem to make a
difference.  Here's a great example of the Unity discoverability
problem.  Since it doesn't /seem/ to make a difference, I don't know
whether to trust the Unity Answers that received 5 upvotes or to go
with parsimony.

A little more digging [[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/210399-4-3-Sprites-and-Lighting][reveals]] that normal maps are particularly
important for lighting.  Since the =Sprite Shader= I intend to use
don't use normal maps, we can leave it out.

** OBJECTION!!

Time to create the =GameObject= that will hold a =MeshRenderer=,
=MeshFilter=, and =MeshCollider=.  According to the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-MeshFilter.html][docs]], a
=MeshFilter= takes a mesh, like the one we created above, and passes
it to the =MeshRenderer= for rendering to the screen.  Not sure what
it's /filtering/ or why there's an intermediate =Component=, but there
you go.  The [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-MeshRenderer.html][docs]] say the =MeshRenderer= then takes the geometry from
the =MeshFilter= and renders it on the screen at the position defined
by the =GameObject='s =Transform=.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var obj: GameObject = new GameObject("New_Plane_From_Script",
                                       MeshRenderer,
                                       MeshFilter,
                                       MeshCollider);
  obj.GetComponent(MeshFilter).mesh = m;
#+END_SRC

** Time for texture

Next we create a =Texture2D= to hold the color information so the box
has some panache.  The =Texture2D= goes into the =MeshRenderer='s
=mainTexture= slot.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var texture: Texture2D;
  texture = new Texture2D(size, size, TextureFormat.ARGB4444, false);
  obj.renderer.material.mainTexture = texture;


#+END_SRC

I don't know too much about how =Texture2D= works right now, but
there's plenty to read in the [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html][docs]].


** A splash of color
Here we generate some random RGB values, normalize them for Unity's
0.0-1.0 colorspace and make a =Color= to put into the =MeshRenderer='s
color slot.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var red: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var green: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var blue: float = Random.Range(63, 255) / 255f;
  var color = Color(red, green, blue);
  obj.renderer.material.color = color;
#+END_SRC

** The crucial shader
At this point, I tested my code and got no errors. However, to my
surprise I didn't see anything rendered on the screen.

I learned that I needed to use a =Sprite Shader= to get the colored
mesh to render properly.  Here's how I did it:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  var spriteShader: Shader = Shader.Find("Sprites/Default");
  obj.renderer.material.shader = spriteShader;
#+END_SRC

** Boxes for dummy
I don't feel so dumb anymore because this was a complex process.  And
it wasn't until the very last crucial step that I saw anything
remotely box-like.

I've posted the code to a gist here so you can clone the script for
yourself, to give it a whirl.  I found that setting =size= to 2 is a
nice place to start.

* Hammock driven creativity
- design
- algorithm
- tools

In 2010, [[https://twitter.com/richhickey][Rich Hickey]] spoke at Clojure Conj about [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Df84n5oFoZBc]['Hammock Driven
Development']].  Hickey was talking about the benefit of down-time for
noodling about software design.  Specifically, Hickey means using
down-time after considerably 'loading up' your mind with aspects of
the problem, in order to leverage background offline processes to
solve those difficult problems.

Hickey's advice is to wait for it.  Wait overnight.  Get good rest and
make sure that you are sleeping well.  Then you will be able to think
about the clearly on the next day.  If you are lucky perhaps you will
receive inspiration from a dream and wake up with the problem solved.
This sort of inspiration is what Hickey means by leveraging background
processing.

Hickey mentions working on more than one project.  By having multiple
projects, you avoid the problems of creative block, or writer's block.
You can be productive simply by working on another project.  One
drawback is that frantically flitting from project to project can lead
to problems finishing any single project.  I am often guilty of this.

I plan on writing about properly scoping projects to make it possible
to get them to a finished state later.  One method that works for me
is getting something to the point that I can write a blog post about
it.  Even if it's not 'finished' finished, I get some satisfaction
with putting it out there in a relatively thought out and complete
form.

My solution is to *record, record, record*.  I keep lots of notes,
both in more structured form on this blog and in more sketchy form in
files on my computer.  I also draw out visual design ideas in a
notebook.  Sometimes I will set up skeleton game projects simply to
test out an idea.  If I have some sudden insight into a problem, then
all of these ideas are available later.

Hickey says to avoid being stuck, switch.  That is why having multiple
projects can help.  Hickey also mentions a great suggestion of talking
about design hiccups and problems with other people.  Tweet about your
design roadblocks.  Write a blog post about them.  Telepathically
communicate about them before you go to sleep, so magical dream elves
can come and solve them for you.

Unless you are Rich Hickey or--I dunno--Gary Gygax, simply thinking
about a problem /a priori/ will not result in a great game.  There is
still something to be said for getting your hands dirty and iterating
on a design.  However the techniques highlighted in Hickey's talk can
be useful when you are stuck on a design problem.

Hit me up in the comments or on the [[https://twitter.com/zerosalife][tweet tweet]] if you have any great
Hammock Driven Design tips that I haven't covered here.

* Thinking about dice games

* Playable Call For Papers
Michael Cook made a "needlessly interactive" [[http://www.exag.org/playablecfp/][playable call for papers]]
for the EXAG conference on AI.  It's a minimally expressive Twine
story, with really one interactive experience role-playing the
interaction the recipient feels upon receiving yet another CFP email,
/click/.

The motivating idea is sound.  Turning banal daily routine into an
interactive experience is a worthy goal for game design.

Math Team Hearts is a speedy modification to hearts that ironically
involves less math than the vanilla game.
