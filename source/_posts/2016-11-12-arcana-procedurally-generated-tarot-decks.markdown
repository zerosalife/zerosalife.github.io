Why not make some art?

Here's [Arcana](https://random-arcana.herokuapp.com/), one of the projects I'm working for [#procjam 2016](https://twitter.com/hashtag/procjam).

Arcana generates a full deck of Tarot cards based on data from [Darius Kazemi's](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions) [corpora project](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora).

-   Click on the cards to expand each card's meaning.

-   Click the button in the corner for a three-card spread from the current deck.

-   Click the title, Arcana, in the title bar to regenerate a fresh deck.
