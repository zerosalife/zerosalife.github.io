Of course, the makeup of a list of game features depend on the particular project in question.  This list of features required to make [*Threes*](http://asherv.com/threes/) feature complete comes from [early on in the published emails about the game's development](http://asherv.com/threes/threemails/#threemails).

## Features

-   Core Game
-   Tutorial
-   Menu Flow
-   Music
-   SFX
-   Monster Animation
-   Game Rotation (for the iPad/PC)
-   Leaderboards
-   Achievements
-   Twitter
-   Skin Packs
-   IAP
-   (Undos?)
-   Puzzlejuice Cross-promotion

The final product has certainly received many times over more polish than the time spent implementing these features and the list may have changed.  But, from time to time, it's nice to see what other successful projects have deemed necessary to get a better sense of how to plan for your own projects.
