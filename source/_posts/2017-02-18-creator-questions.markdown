Taking inspiration from [Allison Parrish's](http://www.decontextualize.com/) talk: [Programming is Forgetting: Toward a New Hacker Ethic](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/), here's my version of Parrish's new hacker ethic for creators:

## Creator Questions

-   Who gets to use what I make?  Who am I leaving out?  How does what I make facilitate or hinder access?
-   What assets am I using?  Whose labor produced them and what biases and assumptions are built in?  What do the assets leave out?
-   What systems of authority am I enacting through what I make?  What systems of support do I rely on?  How does what I make support other people?
-   What kind of community am I assuming?  What community do I invite through what I make?   How are my personal values reflected in what I make?

Watch Allison Parrish's talk for more background on why these sorts of updates are critical for shaping a more welcoming community.
