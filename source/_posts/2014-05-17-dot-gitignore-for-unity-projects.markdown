I found a solution on the [Unity website](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/369755/unity-on-github.html) that pointed me toward [this blogpost](http://t-machine.org/index.php/2012/07/03/unity-git-source-control-a-basic-gitignore/).  But a better solution is out there.  The Double Fine Game Club's Bad Golf Community Edition [.gitignore](https://github.com/Double-Fine-Game-Club/bad-golf-community-edition/blob/master/.gitignore) looks like this:

```sh
[Ll]ibrary/
[Tt]emp/
[Oo]bj/
build_Data/

# Autogenerated VS/MD solution and project files
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.exe
*.userprefs

# OS generated files #
######################
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.[Ss]potlight-V100
.[Tt]rashes
[Ee]hthumbs.db
[Tt]humbs.db
*~
*#*
```

This is the `.gitignore` I'm currently using in my projects.
