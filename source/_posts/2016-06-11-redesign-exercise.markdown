From [The Game Design Workshop book](http://www.gamedesignworkshop.com/):

> One good way to train yourself in the design of game mechanics is to
> challenge yourself with controlled design exercises in which you take
> an existing game system, set a new player experience goal, and make
> changes to the system to meet that goal.
