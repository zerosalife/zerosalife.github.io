[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) is great for mock-ups.  But one major drawback is that [Google Drawings](http://drawings.google.com) doesn't support animation or multiple pages.  Luckily, the same suite of tools is available in Google's [Slides app](https://www.google.com/slides/about/).

## My workflow

Since I'm not a big fan of the cluttered Slides interface, I sketch my mock-ups in Draw and copy them over to Slides.

Using this approach, I rapidly iterate on mock-ups in Draw while keeping a record of the good looking ones as slides in Slides.  As a bonus, I can then shuffle the order of the slides to animate dynamic designs.

I find that this workflow is in keeping with [Draplin Design Co.](http://draplin.com/) owner [Aaron Draplin's design philosophy](https://vimeo.com/113751583): space is cheap, so feel free to experiment and keep everything because you never know what will influence the final design.
