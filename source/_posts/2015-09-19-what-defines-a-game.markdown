I've done it.

I've fallen prey to the temptation to write a ham-fisted article demarking what is, and what isn't, a game--and I'm not even part of the demographic that [Pat Holleman](https://twitter.com/tgdfweb) eloquently calls out in the following tweets.

I think Holleman's definition captures the essence of what [Iwata was talking about](http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/07/18/satoru-iwata/).  Games are play.  Play is fun.

Don't overthink it.  You won't invent an argument that is new or constructive.

Everything doesn't have to fit in a tiny box of your arbitrary creation.  There is a use for lumping things together in useful ways but for the most part this kind tedious of genre-parsing is not constructive.
