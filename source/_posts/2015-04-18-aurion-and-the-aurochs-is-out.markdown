I'm happy to announce that my [#adventurejam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam) game is finished and released.  I'll do a more in-depth post-mortem next week.  In the coming weeks, before the 30-day voting deadline ends, I want to take a look at some of the [other submissions](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games) that pique my interest.

You can [play *Aurion and the Aurochs* on gamejolt](http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738/) and you can [view the source on github](https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion).  Please leave me some feedback in the comments here or on twitter [@zerosalife](https://twitter.com/zerosalife).
