Here are some of my thoughts on my favorite entries to [#adventurejam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam) so far.  Voting ends in a little over two weeks.  So, I'm not ruling out the possibility of looking at more games.

## [Ree's Ruined Earth Courier Service: Shipment Delayed](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/ree-s-ruined-earth-courier-service-shipment-delayed/60572)

-   Amazing graphics.
-   Loving the dialogue.
-   I played the Unity version.

I find the story, characters, and world-building totally compelling.

Unfortunately interacting with the world is proving difficult.  I could use some indication of when I can walk offscreen.  I think that could help with some pathfinding issues.

I'd really like to see more work done on this game, and I'd like to see more content in the Ree's universe.

## [The Endless Night](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/the-endless-night-prelude/58725)

For as much as I wanted to play this game, I couldn't.  The platform restrictions kept me from trying this interesting looking game.  I think the graphics for this game look pretty cool.

## [Speak of the Cloud](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/speak-of-the-cloud/60613)

-   Sound effects do a good job of situating the experience in a world.
-   Loving the *Dr. Strangelove* allusions.
-   Character animations are impressive, and jive well with the cartoon art style.

Unfortunately, I couldn't play this game as much as I would have liked.  It's compelling, and the art design really sells intriguing, interactive spaces that make up for the ridiculous pixel-hunting puzzle I encountered.

## [Walkman](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/walkman/60724)

Like the animation and the constraint of linear movement.

## [Cascade](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/cascade/58292)

-   Got chills from this one.
-   The sparse sound does a great job of communicating atmosphere.
-   Got the sense that there was more to this game than there actually was (in a good way), I think due to the writing.

Nice scoping for a two-week game jam.  I think this is my runner-up, based on the strength of its story.

## [Therapods](http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/theropods/58684/)

-   Great art, animation.
-   Loving the parallax and layering.
-   Great sound design.
-   Great overall design, love the inventory and interface.
-   Great examples of one-screen puzzles.  The puzzles that I've heard Tim Schafer call donkey and rider puzzles.

*Theropods* is my favorite game of the jam.  Not only did it scope the game correctly for the development team, it was also playable in a reasonable amount of time.

## Conclusion

So there you have it, go out there and try some of these games.  If you only have time to try one, check out *[Theropods](http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/theropods/58684/)*.  It's groovy.
