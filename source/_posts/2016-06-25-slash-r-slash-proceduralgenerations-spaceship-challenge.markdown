The June contest on [/r/proceduralgeneration](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/) is to create a [ProceduralSpaceship/Fleet generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/4mn9gj/monthly_challenge_7_june_2016_procedural/).

Here's a look at some of the entries, so far.

## a1studmuffin

[a1studmuffin's](https://github.com/a1studmuffin/SpaceshipGenerator) entry is a Python script that interfaces with Blender to create 3d spaceships.  I'm digging the choices with textures.  I also appreciate that a1studmuffin has commented to describe the phenotype of some of the parameters.  I feel like this code would be good for a future deep dive explaining it.

## Ladus

[Ladus'](http://i.imgur.com/rgs0b5y.png) entry is only shown in a screenshot and a WIP video available on the reddit thread.  The 3d ships rendered in Unreal engine look good.  More of a stylized look in contrast to a1studmuffin's gritty ships.

## NoDownvotesPlease

[NoDownvotesPlease's](http://i.imgur.com/MrjkVU3.gif) entry gets bonus points for creating a galaxy for 2d spaceships to explore.

## Hans\_Meiser\_Koeln

[Hans\_Meiser\_Koeln's](http://i.imgur.com/XcCBnoh.png) entry has some good looking 2d ships.

## green\_meklar

[green\_meklar's](http://imgur.com/a/OZqSv) entry has some nicely [greebled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble) 2d ships made in JavaScript/HTML5.  I'd be interested in seeing the code.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to revisit a1studmuffin's code after the contest ends.
