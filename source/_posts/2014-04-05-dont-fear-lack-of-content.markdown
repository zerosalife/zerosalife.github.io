Came across a [nice article](http://www.egometry.com/gruedorf/a-penny-for-your-thoughts-a-hundred-for-your-life/) on [Ben McGraw's blog, Egometry](http://www.egometry.com/). Using Super Mario Bros. as a model, Ben explains why merely increasing content quantity is less desirable than increasing content substance.  The title of this post is lifted from a quote in his article.

Sometimes exercising a bit of restraint, keeping the focus of your content simple, can still allow for an interesting and engaging player experience.
