I made a sample character so players would get a handle for the [FATE system](http://www.faterpg.com/).  I'm using [FATE Accelerated](http://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated/get-started) to run a [Ghostbusters International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_%28role-playing_game%29)-inspired game.
