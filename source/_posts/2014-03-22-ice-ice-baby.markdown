[Andrew Vestal](http://www.thegia.com/author/avestal/) of [the GIA](http://www.thegia.com/) wrote a [Twine](http://twinery.org/) game for [#cyberpunkjam](http://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam) called [ICE ICE Baby](http://www.thegia.com/avestal/iceicebaby.html).

It's playable in a quick ten minutes.  Parts of the game remind me of the sorts imagination games I would play growing up. This is quite a nice conceit for a text adventure, and it works well here.

I especially like the use of color to mark the transitions between meatspace and cyberspace.
