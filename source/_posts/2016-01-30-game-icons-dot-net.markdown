Here's a handy resource that I will be sure to use in the future: [game-icons.net](//game-icons.net/).

The site has thousands of icons available under a [CC by 3.0 license](//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  I am not a lawyer, but by my read this means you can reuse, redistribute, and remix the icons provided you give appropriate credit, indicate if changes were made, and provide a link to the license.

Check the site out and [tweet me](//twitter.com/zerosalife) if you use or have used the icons in your game.
