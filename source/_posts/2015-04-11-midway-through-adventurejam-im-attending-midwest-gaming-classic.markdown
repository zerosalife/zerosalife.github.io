## Quick update on #adventurejam

I feel like my game is on track to finish next Friday.  I'm happy to say it's feature complete.  I'll spend the next week polishing, various flavors of bughunting (maybe even some bugfishing and bugtrapping), and, most important of all, prosifying.  My goal is to come up with a little game that's compelling to play, rather than just a series of links to click.

## Midwest Gaming Classic

Instead of a normal blog post, I want to take this time to shout out the [@MGC_gaming](http://twitter.com/MGC_gaming), [Midwest Gaming Classic](https://twitter.com/mgc_gaming).  I'll be attending today.  So if you're there hit me up [@zerosalife](http://twitter.com/zerosalife).
