In **two weeks**, April 3 - April 17, [Cassie Benter](https://twitter.com/fenderbenter) and [Stacy Davidson](https://twitter.com/stacydavidson) are hosting a game jam focused on creating adventure games called [#adventurejam](http://adventurejam.org).  I share the organizers' love of point-and-click adventure games, and I'm totally thrilled to announce my participation.  AdventureJam is a fortnight-long competition to create and adventurous game-ish experience.

The [rules](http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/rules) of AdventureJam are more strict than [#procjam](http://procjam.tumblr.com/), [the jam I participated in last fall](http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/01/make-things-that-make-things-number-procjam-2014/).  They require that the work on a game take place over the two weeks of the AdventureJam competition.  I don't expect to have the time to create something that is truly competitive, but I may as well play along.  Like #procjam, I plan on spending the next series of blog posts covering AdventureJam-related content.

So, click every pixel on the screen, grab everything in sight, exhaust every dialog option, and combine items in new and mysterious ways, it's [#adventurejam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdventureJam?src=hash) time.

I'd like to spend the rest of this post exploring the options in terms of game engines for creating adventure games.  The website and forums were great resources for constructing this list.  And I suspect that I'll come across some new resources as the jam progresses.

## Engines (Or, A Decidedly Unresearched and Perfunctory List)

### Graphical

#### Windows

-   <http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/>

-   <http://dead-code.org/home/>

#### Non-windows

-   <http://codecanyon.net/item/jaguar-lucasarts-adventure-game-engine/8753130>

-   [Visionaire](http://www.visionaire-studio.net/)

-   <http://www.alpacaengine.com/>

#### Unity

-   <http://age.seccia.com/>

-   [Adventure Creator](http://www.adventurecreator.org/)

### Text

-   [Inform](http://inform7.com/)

-   [Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest)

-   [Twine](http://twinery.org/)

## The Adventure Jam Forums

The [#adventurejam forums](http://www.adventurejam.org/forums/) were a great resource for constructing this overview of adventure game engines.  I only expect the information there to grow as the jam progresses.

## My Plan

Given my workload, familiarity with and access to the tools listed above, and artistic abilities, I'm going to go with Twine to get any real progress done in the time constraints.

Like my [series of posts on #procjam](http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/procjam/), I'll tag all the [posts related to AdventureJam](http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/adventurejam/) so they're easily accessible.
