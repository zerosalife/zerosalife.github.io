  <div class="entry-content"><h2>#procjam updates</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q%3Dprocjam">#procjam</a> is upon us.  The conference is on and popping, streaming at <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/procjam">http://www.twitch.tv/procjam</a>.  I&rsquo;ll try to precede my #procjam posts with a little update on some of the cool things I&rsquo;ve seen that need pointing out during the jam itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate">@GalaxyKate</a> will be streaming <a href="http://vimeo.com/111272682">some tutorials</a> today, following the conference.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SudoRossy">@sudorossy</a> is currently streaming some development and modeling at <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/sudorossy">http://www.twitch.tv/sudorossy</a>.  I imagine that sudorossy will continue this throughout the jam.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q%3D7dfps">#7dfps</a> jam is also going on this week.  So, I&rsquo;ve decided to release my third person procedural tweeter.  Or maybe it&rsquo;s a fourth person tweeter, third person once removed.</p>

<h2>Fourth-person tweets</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m at it again, <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/19/styx-ebooks/">making a twitter bot</a> like <a href="https://twitter.com/styx_ebooks">@styx_ebooks</a>.  Only this time it&rsquo;s in a completely different language and it&rsquo;s got a completely different corpus.  Corpus is a Latin way of saying text, in case you forgot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that I&rsquo;m going to participate in the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam">upcoming procedural game jam called #procjam</a>.  #procjam is a global game jam and a live-streamed conference in London focused on making things that make things. You can keep up to date by following the jam tumblr <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/">procjam.tumblr.com</a>. There&rsquo;s already a <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/post/99689402659/procedural-generation-tutorials-getting-started">handy list of procedural generation tutorials available on the tumblug</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to submitting one or two projects I&rsquo;ve been working on, I&rsquo;d like to cover the content of the talks with perspective and reactions, and to check out the contest entries after it&rsquo;s finished <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/07/26/space-is-read/">like I did for <em>Space Is Red</em> from #spacecowboyjam</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say this will be a month-long endeavor, what with my weekly (ish) blogging schedule.  With one or two posts focused on submissions, I think four blog posts may be conservative, so I&rsquo;ll keep writing as long as I&rsquo;m interested.</p>

<p>To make it easier to follow along, I&rsquo;ll tag up all the posts with the procjam category and I&rsquo;ll try to do the same for the tweet announcements, even if it&rsquo;s out of style because the jam was weeks ago.  That&rsquo;s how committed I am to making this happen.</p>

<p>If you get the sense that I&rsquo;m trying to psych myself up for this, I am.</p>

<p>The next couple of months will be very busy in my life.  I&rsquo;ll be traveling and attending conferences, activities that have traditionally consumed my precious blogging time like so many Frito pies.</p>

<p>I may be setting the bar high, but if anything the purpose for aiming high is success.  All too often I hear about jams in the middle when everyone is tweeting out cool prototypes and in the thick of design, or I&rsquo;ll hear about a jam when the contest is long over because someone pointed out that the winning entry was amazing.  Through dumb luck and exquisite taste in following <a href="https://twitter.com/mtrc">@mtrc on twitter</a>, I heard about this gamejam with enough lead time to mark it on my calendar.</p>

<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t produce anything interesting or important, by gum, I&rsquo;m going to participate in and cover this gamejam.  I&rsquo;m not going to let another really cool gamejam slip under the radar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here I&rsquo;m drawing a comparison between games that are subjectively perceived as party games and games that are more in-depth.  I&rsquo;m avoiding using loaded terms like casual and hardcore, but I think the distinction is likely the same.  Both types of games can be complex, but subtle balancing issues can affect the subjective sense of fun when playing these games.</p>

<p>For discussion I&rsquo;m going to focus on relatively advanced moves in <em><a href="http://www.smashbros.com">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.towerfall-game.com/">TowerFall</a></em>: L-canceling and dodge canceling, respectively.  I was inspired to examine this balance issue by a recent tweet by <em>TowerFall</em> creator, and, in the interest of full disclosure, my close personal 3DS friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/MattThorson">@MattThorson</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&rsquo;d like to look at how to bet in the spectator mode of <em>Super Smash Bros. on 3DS</em>.  I&rsquo;m surprised by how much I enjoy /Super Smash Bros.&lsquo;/ spectator mode.  It adds the thrill of a horse race alongside an already great game.</p>

<p>Here are some of the betting strategies I&rsquo;ve found useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always bet the full amount</li>
<li>Always bet your earnings</li>
<li>Bet the odds</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take your money and run</li>
<li>Know the metagame</li>
<li>Know the good players, you may see them again.</li>
<li>Set limits</li>
<li>Trust your judgment</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I reached out on twitter in a somewhat misguided appeal to #gamedev, asking whether devs consider ethics when designing games.  Apparently there is so much traffic on #gamedev that any tweet will be lost in a deluge of announcements and automated bot retweets.  Oh well, I thought, I&rsquo;ll go it alone.  Given the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/intel-pulls-ads-from-site-after-gamergate-boycott/">recent tone in the communities surrounding games</a>, I feel the need to examine this question: <strong>Do ethics matter in game design?</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brief note here.  Following a Summer of travel and visitors, posts should be returning to a more regular schedule soon.  It&rsquo;s great when I can post here regularly, but I&rsquo;m not going to get bent out of shape when I have other commitments.  So, if there are unannounced, prolonged absences, you can assume that it has something to do with spending my weekends traveling or socializing, which is undoubtedly a good thing.</p>

<p>I recently came across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18225126/how-to-use-git-for-unity3d-source-control">this stackoverflow answer</a> introducing git for version control in Unity projects.  Note, the question specifically refers to Unity3D, but this will work for Unity2D as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/05/17/dot-gitignore-for-unity-projects/">already written</a> about setting up a <code>.gitignore</code> file.  Here are some steps you can take to optimize the way Unity stores information, so git can track it.</p>

<p>Git was built to work by <code>diffing</code> large files containing text, specifically code.  Git works just fine with binary files, but it defaults to a less efficient method to <code>diff</code> those files, which can result in bloated git repositories.  Nobody wants a bloated git repository.</p>

<p>Here I&rsquo;ll summarize two of the steps from the answer that I found helpful, using Unity v4.5+.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that these steps will increase the size of your project&mdash;although I&rsquo;m unsure whether they affect the size of any deployed binaries.</p>

<p>So if the size of the project on your development machine is a critical issue, you may want to think about keeping the default settings.  The project I tried the steps on went from 86.7 MB on disk (including its bloated git repository) to 86.9 MB, so it&rsquo;s probably not going to create an appreciable change in most projects.</p>

<h2>Switch to Visible Meta Files</h2>

<p>Switch to <code>Visible Meta Files</code> in the Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode Menu.</p>

<p>If the <code>Visible Meta Files</code> option is turned on, the <code>.meta</code> files associated with parts of your project will have textual information rather than binary.</p>

<h2>Switch to Force Text</h2>

<p>Switch to <code>Force Text</code> in the Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Menu.</p>

<p>If you choose <code>Force Text</code> this will cause Unity to use text to serialize assets that it would normally store as binary files.</p>

<h2>Save</h2>

<p>Save the Scene and project for these changes to take effect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What would make a pachinko RPG?  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/16/one-tap-quest-a-pachinko-rpg/">Last week</a>, I wrote about how I&rsquo;m sort of enamored with <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest&rsquo;s</a></em> tap-and-let-them-go interaction, which I think mirrors the play-style of pachinko.  In pachinko, you have some control over launching the little metal balls, but once they&rsquo;re in play, they&rsquo;re on their own.  This mechanism stands in contrast to pinball, where you interact with a single or multiple pinballs with the paddles, and cue sports (especially bumper pool), where you launch a billiard ball repeatedly with a cue.</p>

<p>As I said last week, I think the basic gameplay in <em>One Tap Quest</em> is interesting enough for a 10-minute session.  But I&rsquo;d like to take this concept and run with it, if you&rsquo;ll let me.  What follows are some concepts that, I think, extend the <em>One Tap Quest</em> pachinko RPG model.</p>

<h2>Player characters</h2>

<p>As I conceive of it, a pachinko RPG is sort of like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_101">Wonderful 101</a></em>.  A changing stock of characters go up against an overwhelming group of enemies.  Just like pachinko rewards players with more pachinko balls, worth real money, a pachinko RPG would need to reward the player with ever more&mdash;and ever more interesting&mdash;characters to bolster the stock and the player&rsquo;s score.  A given character can gain levels when unleashed on the board, a little more unique than generic pachinko balls.  Perhaps characters added to the stock later in the game come at a higher starting level, sort of like characters recruited in later sections of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_Battle:_The_March_of_the_Black_Queen">Ogre Battle</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>Procedurally generated &ldquo;boards&rdquo; could make a game interesting.  Presenting a variable layout of enemies, terrain, and power-ups can challenge players who are already familiar with the basic gameplay.  I don&rsquo;t think that using roguelike elements, such as varying the effects of power-ups like potions in <em><a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a></em> would work very well.  However, incorporating a quest or narrative adventure framework above the level of boards could be engaging.  Here I&rsquo;m using the word level to refer to a conceptual level of hierarchical relationships, rather than an experience level or a stage in a game.  I&rsquo;m talking about the approach that <em><a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a></em> and the built-in 3DS RPG, <em><a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Find_Mii_%283DS%29">Find Mii</a></em>, take.  Each &ldquo;board&rdquo; is a gameplay experience in itself, and the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; have a larger (in terms of conceptual scope) map that ties them together and gives the player a sense of progression or quest completion.</p>

<p>Obstacles on the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; that impair the movement of either player characters or enemies could add another layer of strategy.  In effect these terrain elements could construct a puzzle that they player has to solve by starting their player character down the correct &ldquo;lane&rdquo;, and being lucky enough to gain the required number of levels to beat the &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This approach to using obstacles to make puzzles would require some clever level design.  A puzzle where there is a single right way to complete it would be boring, once you find it you simply wait until you get the required number of levels through sheer luck&mdash;pointless repetition without interesting choices.  However puzzles where there are (or seem to be) multiple routes to complete the &ldquo;board&rdquo; can be interesting.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>I think it might be cool to maintain control over the character after you launch.  In a sense you would be an invisible hand, maintaining control over the pachinko ball as it rolls through the machine.  This game would be sort of like an inverted bullet-hell shoot &lsquo;em up.  Rather than dodging enemies, you would guide your character toward them.  It is probably worth iterating on this mechanic, because <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> seems to use it with relative success.  But I think maintaining control over the character would block out the cheering-your-character-on-from-the-sidelines aspect that I enjoyed in One Tap Quest, and would like to emulate.</p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>

<p>As I mentioned previously, added depth of enemy behavior and power-ups could prolong the experience.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what this would entail at this point, but I think iterating on the basic concepts laid out in <em>One Tap Quest</em> could lead to some interesting variation.  That sentence pretty much sums up my take on what would make an interesting pachinko RPG.  Thanks for letting me spew some thoughts that are little more than design notes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently played <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest</a></em>, a game in which you tap to place an RPG character who marches upward, gaining levels by bumping into enemies, to tackle bigger and badder foes.  What&rsquo;s interesting to me, if you&rsquo;ll bear with me, is that this is a game that amounts to a pachinko RPG.  I&rsquo;ll start by talking about what I liked about <em>One Tap Quest</em>.  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg/">Next week</a>, I&rsquo;ll get into what I mean by a pachinko RPG.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I come to a new gameplay experience completely naive these days. The only way I feel I can effectively spend my time with a game is typically after having read some sort of guide because my time is extremely limited.</p>

<p>What the <em>One Tap Quest</em> accomplished so well for me was going from barely being able to read the screen to beating the game over the course of 10 minutes.  Admittedly it&rsquo;s a very short and simple game.  But I felt a sense of accomplishment every time my understanding of the mechanics grew.</p>

<p>Oh, these little critters are stronger than these other little critters, better avoid them.  Oh these are power ups, not critters, better aim for them.  With these skills under my belt it only took a little luck to send my character on a march toward victory.</p>

<p>The place where this idea shines is in the power-ups.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ve encountered all of them, but they range from simple buffs that grant free levels to expanding your party into a 3-character-wide enemy-wrecking plow.  For what it&rsquo;s worth, the power-ups were deep enough to keep me interested over 10 minutes of gameplay.  If I were going to engage with this experience over a longer term, I would suggest adding more depth to the power-ups and the enemies, which are as far as I can tell simply harder to kill, and possibly bigger, versions of the puny slimes that move back and forth.  Some of the enemies have variations on the simple random walk style movement of the slimes, but a richer variety of movement and behavior from the enemies would increase the required skill to play the game, and add to replayability.</p>

<p>I think the power-up mechanics add a level of depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a hands-off luck-of-the-draw game.  By aiming for power-ups you have a sense of agency in the action, just like turning the knob controls the velocity at which pachinko balls are launched.  It makes cheering for your lemming-like character(s) more enjoyable: if they could just get a little closer and grab the power-up you aimed at&mdash;no.  Nope, they died.</p>

<p>Go give this great little game a try.  Hopefully it will pique your interest like it piqued mine.  Quirky variations on RPGs seem to be part of the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, with <em><a href="http://www.atlus.com/rollers/">Rollers of the Realm</a></em> and <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> blending pinball and console genre gameplay with the potential synergy <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> never achieved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m interested in having some data remain available, even though I&rsquo;m switching Scenes in Unity.  In other words, I want this data to remain persistent.  As you&rsquo;ll see below I was tempted to use <code>PlayerPrefs</code> to store the data, but, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJ6FfcJpbPXE">this Unity Live Training on Data Persistence</a>, <code>PlayerPrefs</code> is not the best way to make data persist over multiple Scenes.  <code>PlayerPrefs</code> is an okay place to store non-critical data, like the audio volume, window size, full-screen state&#x2013;you know preferences.  I&rsquo;ll go ahead and show what I believe to be the correct way to store persistent data before talking about <code>PlayerPrefs</code> later.</p>
