    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Unity documentation has an example showing how to generate random indexes satisfying a distribution of probabilities (see: <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RandomNumbers.html">Choosing Items with Different Probabilities</a>).  In this post I&rsquo;ll show how to use a similar approach to generate random items with specific probabilities dictated by the environment.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I want to be able to generate an item code, say <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Black</code>, given a list of floating point probabilities dictated by the current environmental area in my game, say for example <code>desert</code> or <code>grassland</code>.</p>

<p>Varying the probability of encountering items will give each area a unique flavor.  If the player needs a <code>Red</code> item, the player will need to seek out areas in which the probability for encountering <code>Red</code> items is high.  I hope this will drive player exploration and investigation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start by defining an array of possible item types.  (According to <a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Head_First_into_Unity_with_UnityScript#Use_enum">this introduction to Unity JavaScript</a>, I should prefer <code>enum</code>.)</p>

<p><code>javascript
var ents : String[] = ["Red", "Green", "Black", "Orange"];
</code></p>

<p>Since this is a small example, I&rsquo;ll forego the efficiency and security that <code>enum</code>s provide for the convenience of using a simple <code>String</code> array.  I&rsquo;ll note that this is a good spot to do some refactoring in a real project where a variety of systems may have to interact with the item types.</p>

<p>I then define a Dictionary <code>areas</code> of Lists of floating point probabilities.  These areas correspond to terrains that contain unique distributions of items. The <code>areas</code> Dictionary accepts <code>String</code>s specifying the desired terrain.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the order of the probabilities correspond to the order of the item types in <code>ent</code>s.</p>

<p><code>javascript
var areas = new Dictionary.&lt;String, List.&lt;float&gt; &gt;();
areas["desert"] = new List.&lt;float&gt;([0.1, 0.05, 0.425, 0.425]);
areas["grassland"] = new List.&lt;float&gt;([0.3, 0.35, 0.1, 0.25]);
</code></p>

<p>So, in the <code>grassland</code> area, there will be a 30% chance of choosing a <code>Red</code> item.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve defined the data, I need a function to choose the appropriate index given a List of probabilities.  This function is lifted with minor modifications from the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html">Unity Documentation</a>.  Take a look at that documentation for a better visualization of the algorithm than I could do with words.  Really, do it!</p>

<p>``` javascript
function Choose(probs : List.<float>) : int {</p>

<pre><code>// Returns the index of a probabilistically determined random
// entity, given by the probability distributions in probs.
// e.g.:
// probs : List.&lt;float&gt;([0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2]);
// entity = entities[Choose(probs)];
//
// See http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/RandomNumbers.html

// Watch out!  If you fail to specify total's type as float, it
// will add the probs using integer addition.  This will floor
// each of the probs to 0.
var total : float = 0;

for (x in probs) {
    total += x;
}

var randomPoint = Random.value * total;

for(var i = 0; i &lt; probs.Count; i++) {
    if (randomPoint &lt; probs[i])
        return i;
    else
        // Shift the strip down, adjusting the random point's
        // value to see whether it falls within the next prob.
        randomPoint -= probs[i];
}
// Take care of possibility that randomPoint is 1.0 or 100% by
// returning the last element of probs.  Avoids allowing Choose to
// return a 0 probability event (which would be possible using the
// &lt;= test).
return probs(probs.Count - 1);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now to choose an item:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var item = ents[Choose(areas["grassland"])];
Debug.Log(item);
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I&rsquo;ve put an <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/ProbEntitySpawnExample">example Unity project with this code on github</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/06/13/creating-a-dictionary-of-lists-in-unity-javascript/">Last week</a>, I published an article about creating a Dictionary of Lists in Unity using Unity&rsquo;s JavaScript.  Some of the syntax is changed in C#, but the overall algorithm is exactly the same.  I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the underlying motive, so I&rsquo;ll dive right in.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here&rsquo;s how to create a Dictionary of Lists in C# for Unity.</p>

<p>```csharp
Dictionary&lt;string, List<int>> table = new Dictionary&lt;string, List<int>>();</p>

<p>void Start() {</p>

<pre><code>// Fill our table with Lists containing ints using Arrays to intialize
// the Lists.
table["a"] = new List&lt;int&gt;(){1};
table["b"] = new List&lt;int&gt;(){2};
table["c"] = new List&lt;int&gt;(){3};

foreach(string str in table.Keys) {
    // Get the value for our Key.
    List&lt;int&gt; value = table[str];

    // If the Key is the desired Key, append to its list.
    if(str == "c") {
        value.Add(4);
    }

    // print the first item in each of the Lists.
    Debug.Log(value[0]);
}

// Print the appended item to see that it worked.
Debug.Log(table["c"][1]);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>These are the main differences between the Unity JavaScript and C# code.  Take a look at the full file in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/zerosalife/e3882aa5ffd5dd614c9a">gist on github</a>.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/06/13/creating-a-dictionary-of-lists-in-unity-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into a few problems trying to create a <a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_Dictionary">Dictionary</a> of <a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DWhich_Kind_Of_Array_Or_Collection_Should_I_Use%253F#Generic_List">Lists</a> in Unity JavaScript.  So I thought I&rsquo;d share some of the tips I learned here.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;m interested in creating a Dictionary to hold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators">Markov Chain information</a> in order to generate text.  So I&rsquo;d like to be able to create a Dictionary holding a variable length of items for each of its Keys.  I&rsquo;d also like to be able to update the mapping at runtime.</p>

<p>It would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Key1:</strong> Item1, Item2, Item3</li>
<li><strong>Key2:</strong> Item4</li>
</ul>


<p>At runtime, I&rsquo;d like to be able to say: &ldquo;Append <code>Item5</code> to <code>Key2</code>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I came up with in Unity JavaScript.  I started out by initializing a <code>table</code> in my script prior to the <code>Start</code> function. The var <code>table</code> holds our mapping of Keys of type <code>String</code> to Values of type <code>List.&lt;int&gt;</code>, or Lists of integers.</p>

<p><code>javascript
import System.Collections.Generic;
// White space matters.
var table:Dictionary.&lt;String,List.&lt;int&gt; &gt; = new Dictionary.&lt;String,List.&lt;int&gt; &gt;();
</code></p>

<p>The first hiccup I ran into is that <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/80227-Creating-a-Dictionary-of-Lists-in-Javascript?p%3D513471&amp;viewfull%3D1#post513471">white space matters</a> when creating Generics in Unity JavaScript.  The compiler will throw an error if it sees two <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in a row.</p>

<p>Then I fill the table with our test mappings.</p>

<p><code>javascript
// Fill our table with Lists containing ints using Arrays to intialize
// the Lists.
table["a"] = new List.&lt;int&gt;([1]);
table["b"] = new List.&lt;int&gt;([2]);
table["c"] = new List.&lt;int&gt;([3]);
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, you can <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/221476/javascript-array-to-generic-list.html">construct a List from an Array</a>.  Cool.</p>

<p>In the <code>Start</code> function, I iterate over the Keys in the Dictionary, Add the item <code>4</code> to the Value of Key <code>c</code>, and print out the first item of each of the <code>values</code>.  Finally, we check to see whether <code>4</code> was appended to the desired entry.</p>

<p>```javascript
function Start () {</p>

<pre><code>// Iterate over the Keys in our Dictionary.
for(var str:String in table.Keys) {
    // Get the value for our Key.
    var value:List.&lt;int&gt; = table[str];

    // If the Key is our desired Key, append to its list.
    if (str == "c") {
        value.Add(4);
    }

    // Print the first item in each of the Lists.
    print(value[0]);
}

// Print the appended item to see that it worked.
print(table["c"][1]);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Then I attach this script to the Main Camera of a fresh Scene for testing purposes.  Bada bing, bada boom.</p>

<p>Attaching the script to any old object in the scene would work.  I just chose the Main Camera because the camera object is there by default.</p>

<p>This was all relatively straightforward, after I understood some of the quirks of Unity&rsquo;s JavaScript syntax.  You can find an example script using this code <a href="https://gist.github.com/zerosalife/f13eb62bf7bd57799db6">here</a>.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-28T10:20:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/28/building-twine-games-from-the-command-line</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got it in my craw to write a short <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> game a while back.  I wanted to familiarize myself with the language.  And writing a short game in Twine seemed to be lower hanging fruit than trying to implement my own text adventure framework for Unity or some other game engine.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Why not Unity?</h2>

<p>That being said, there are other text adventure frameworks available in the Unity App Store and there&rsquo;s a very intriguing Twine parser for Unity called <a href="http://www.platoevolved.com/blog/unity-plugins/#!/~/product/category%3D2743024&amp;id%3D35627540">Yarn</a>.</p>

<p>Yarn seems well suited to writing Bioware- and Black Isle-style dialogues, where individual characters' dialogues are stored in separate Twine files with scripts to load them at runtime.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it does anything to solve the woes of writing a larger (than one dialog tree) game in the usual Twine GUI.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s too much to be learned by implementing things available on the Unity App Store for me to pass that up in favor of saving time.  It&rsquo;s true that my time is the most valuable asset I have, but it&rsquo;s also very likely that I&rsquo;ll spend just as much time trying to figure out or modify a Unity plugin from the App Store as I would trying to implement something similar on my own.  That being said, in this case for what I wanted to do, Twine was the path of least resistance.</p>

<h2>Why the command line?</h2>

<p>I live in my text editor.  So, having to write in the Twine GUI tool&rsquo;s rudimentary text editor isn&rsquo;t really my bag.  I&rsquo;ve trained my muscle memory to use these short cuts without thinking.  In fact, I don&rsquo;t even bother to backspace to correct typos, I use the keyboard shortcut in my editor to automatically step through the suggested spelling corrections for the last word.  I&rsquo;m entrenched.</p>

<p>Also, dealing with the visual clutter of the Twine GUI drives me nuts.  If I want 30 links from a single Twine Passage, I don&rsquo;t want to have to do that manually, and I certainly don&rsquo;t want to try to organize it so it&rsquo;s visually appealing.  There&rsquo;re algorithms for that visualizing stuff, and algorithms are better at it (than I am).</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The first step is to <a href="https://github.com/tweecode/twee">install <code>twee</code></a> the command line tool used to compile Twine files.</p>

<p>Then <em>all</em> you have to do is write your story in the proper <a href="https://github.com/tweecode/TwineQuest/wiki/Twee-file-format">Twine file format</a>.  This is the hardest part, not because the syntax is complicated, but because you&rsquo;ve actually got to come up with an interesting and interactive story!</p>

<h2>Compiling your twine files</h2>

<p><code>Twee</code> will output files to HTML formatted in the usual Twine style.  It gets tedious to type commands over and over again, so I automate building the HTML with a Makefile.</p>

<p>```make Makefile
story.html : <em>.tw tweefiles/</em>.tw</p>

<pre><code>    ~/twee/twee -t sugarcane $^ &gt; $@
    open story.html
</code></pre>

<p>json: <em>.tw tweefiles/</em>.tw</p>

<pre><code>    ~/twee/twee -t json $^ &gt; story.json
</code></pre>

<p>clean:</p>

<pre><code>    rm -f story.html
</code></pre>

<p>.PHONY: json
```</p>

<p>Placing this Makefile in the root of your twine directory allows you to compile the HTML file by the commands <code>make clean; make</code>.  You can read more about the Makefile syntax in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax">GNU make manual</a>.  The Makefile looks for Twine file format ending in <code>.tw</code>, either in the root directory or a directory for <code>tweefiles/</code>.</p>

<p>You can also compile to the JSON format by using <code>make json</code>.</p>

<h2>Getting some of the newer Twine features to work</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/tweecode/twee/issues/12">couldn&rsquo;t get some of the newer Twine features to work</a> when I compiled the twee code from the command line.  I think this stems from the twee command line tool failing to parse some of the newer features implemented in the Twine GUI.</p>

<p>In order to get some of the newer features to work, use the <code>Makefile</code> to compile the twee code, then import the resulting <code>.html</code> file in the Twine GUI.  Finally export HTML from the Twine GUI.</p>

<p>That being said, it was still nice to rapidly iterate through versions of a story without having to get bogged down in the Twine GUI.  I could write Twine code organized in files in a logical arrangement, then compile them into a single HTML file for testing and release.  Let me know if you have suggestions that would improve this Twine workflow or if you take a different approach.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/hosting-a-game-on-itch-dot-io-account-set-up-and-transaction-fees</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is itch.io?</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="http://itch.io/about/faq">faq</a>, itch.io is a service for handling hosting and selling individual and bundled games, soundtracks, art, etc.  It has some handy features to <a href="http://itch.io/jams">manage and track gamejams</a> as well.  It was <a href="http://leafo.net/posts/introducing_itchio.html">created</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/moonscript">@moonscript</a>.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll look at the fees charged itch.io and the supported payment platforms and how to set up an account.  The <a href="http://itch.io/about/faq">faq</a> covers these and other topics in more detail so make sure you peruse it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>There are a few payment options available on itch.io.  Here&rsquo;s how the fees break down.  I&rsquo;ll use the example of selling $5.00 and $2.00 games to show the revenue you could expect to receive after taking out the various fees.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that, at of the time of this post, <strong>itch.io is not collecting fees</strong>.  I&rsquo;ll still present the revenue calculations with the itch.io slice factored in, but itch.io won&rsquo;t start collecting a percentage of the game price until a later, unspecified date.</p>

<p>Itch.io currently provides three options for handling payments: <a href="http://payments.amazon.com/">Amazon Payments</a>, <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> and <a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.</p>

<h3>Supported currencies</h3>

<p>PayPal appears to be the least restrictive in terms of the countries and currencies it handles.  Stripe handles U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and Ireland.  Stripe has an <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-countries-does-stripe-support">open beta for some European countries</a>. Amazon Payments only handles U.S. currencies.  Non-U.S. purchases through Amazon Payments are <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/about?nodeId%3D77175#aspd_cost">only allowed via credit card transactions, and there&rsquo;s an additional charge</a>.</p>

<h3>Fee structure</h3>

<p>The fees for <a href="https://stripe.com/us/pricing">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees">PayPal</a> work similarly, assuming you&rsquo;re processing less than $3,000 monthly.  There&rsquo;s a base fee of $0.30 + 2.9% for each transaction.  Amazon Payments works similarly if the price is above $10.00, but below $9.99, there&rsquo;s a $0.05 surcharge + 5%.</p>

<p>Itch.io will charge a 10% fee for each transaction, but currently this charge is waived.</p>

<h3>Down and dirty</h3>

<p>So let&rsquo;s do the math for the two example prices I mentioned above:</p>

<p>For Stripe and PayPal the numbers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$5 - ($5 * 0.1) - $0.30 - ($5 * 0.029) = $4.055

$2 - ($2 * 0.1) - $0.30 - ($2 * 0.029) = $1.442
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the rounding works.  I will have to reach out to itch.io and the payment handling services to see how they handle tenths of a cent.</p>

<p>For Amazon Payments the numbers look like:</p>

<pre><code>$5 - ($5 * 0.1) - $0.05 - ($5 * 0.05) = $4.20

$2 - ($2 * 0.1) - $0.05 - ($2 * 0.05) = $1.65
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind, for each of these calculations you&rsquo;ll get an extra $0.50 and $0.20, respectively, since the itch.io surcharge is not in effect.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how the numbers breakdown for these price points.  I&rsquo;m not planning on charging money right now, but it&rsquo;s nice to see the real amounts you can expect to see.  I am really bad at reasoning about these sorts of percentages in the abstract.</p>

<h2>Signing up</h2>

<p><a href="http://itch.io/register">Registering for itch.io</a> was easy.  I created an account and checked <code>I'm interested in distributing games on itch.io</code>.  That&rsquo;s it.  It&rsquo;s very straightforward.</p>

<p>Now I have a relatively spartan page at <a href="http://zerosalife.itch.io/">zerosalife.itch.io</a>.</p>

<h2>The next step</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to brand and personalize my itch.io page, but I don&rsquo;t think that the time for that is now.  Somewhere down the road, I&rsquo;ll look into itch.io&rsquo;s powerful customization tools.</p>

<p>The obvious clear thing to do with my new itch.io account is to release a game.  Tune in next week for exactly that!</p>
