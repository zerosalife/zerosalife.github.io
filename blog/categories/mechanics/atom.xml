    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What would make a pachinko RPG?  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/16/one-tap-quest-a-pachinko-rpg/">Last week</a>, I wrote about how I&rsquo;m sort of enamored with <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest&rsquo;s</a></em> tap-and-let-them-go interaction, which I think mirrors the play-style of pachinko.  In pachinko, you have some control over launching the little metal balls, but once they&rsquo;re in play, they&rsquo;re on their own.  This mechanism stands in contrast to pinball, where you interact with a single or multiple pinballs with the paddles, and cue sports (especially bumper pool), where you launch a billiard ball repeatedly with a cue.</p>

<p>As I said last week, I think the basic gameplay in <em>One Tap Quest</em> is interesting enough for a 10-minute session.  But I&rsquo;d like to take this concept and run with it, if you&rsquo;ll let me.  What follows are some concepts that, I think, extend the <em>One Tap Quest</em> pachinko RPG model.</p>

<h2>Player characters</h2>

<p>As I conceive of it, a pachinko RPG is sort of like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_101">Wonderful 101</a></em>.  A changing stock of characters go up against an overwhelming group of enemies.  Just like pachinko rewards players with more pachinko balls, worth real money, a pachinko RPG would need to reward the player with ever more&mdash;and ever more interesting&mdash;characters to bolster the stock and the player&rsquo;s score.  A given character can gain levels when unleashed on the board, a little more unique than generic pachinko balls.  Perhaps characters added to the stock later in the game come at a higher starting level, sort of like characters recruited in later sections of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_Battle:_The_March_of_the_Black_Queen">Ogre Battle</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>Procedurally generated &ldquo;boards&rdquo; could make a game interesting.  Presenting a variable layout of enemies, terrain, and power-ups can challenge players who are already familiar with the basic gameplay.  I don&rsquo;t think that using roguelike elements, such as varying the effects of power-ups like potions in <em><a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a></em> would work very well.  However, incorporating a quest or narrative adventure framework above the level of boards could be engaging.  Here I&rsquo;m using the word level to refer to a conceptual level of hierarchical relationships, rather than an experience level or a stage in a game.  I&rsquo;m talking about the approach that <em><a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a></em> and the built-in 3DS RPG, <em><a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Find_Mii_%283DS%29">Find Mii</a></em>, take.  Each &ldquo;board&rdquo; is a gameplay experience in itself, and the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; have a larger (in terms of conceptual scope) map that ties them together and gives the player a sense of progression or quest completion.</p>

<p>Obstacles on the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; that impair the movement of either player characters or enemies could add another layer of strategy.  In effect these terrain elements could construct a puzzle that they player has to solve by starting their player character down the correct &ldquo;lane&rdquo;, and being lucky enough to gain the required number of levels to beat the &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This approach to using obstacles to make puzzles would require some clever level design.  A puzzle where there is a single right way to complete it would be boring, once you find it you simply wait until you get the required number of levels through sheer luck&mdash;pointless repetition without interesting choices.  However puzzles where there are (or seem to be) multiple routes to complete the &ldquo;board&rdquo; can be interesting.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>I think it might be cool to maintain control over the character after you launch.  In a sense you would be an invisible hand, maintaining control over the pachinko ball as it rolls through the machine.  This game would be sort of like an inverted bullet-hell shoot &lsquo;em up.  Rather than dodging enemies, you would guide your character toward them.  It is probably worth iterating on this mechanic, because <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> seems to use it with relative success.  But I think maintaining control over the character would block out the cheering-your-character-on-from-the-sidelines aspect that I enjoyed in One Tap Quest, and would like to emulate.</p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>

<p>As I mentioned previously, added depth of enemy behavior and power-ups could prolong the experience.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what this would entail at this point, but I think iterating on the basic concepts laid out in <em>One Tap Quest</em> could lead to some interesting variation.  That sentence pretty much sums up my take on what would make an interesting pachinko RPG.  Thanks for letting me spew some thoughts that are little more than design notes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently played <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest</a></em>, a game in which you tap to place an RPG character who marches upward, gaining levels by bumping into enemies, to tackle bigger and badder foes.  What&rsquo;s interesting to me, if you&rsquo;ll bear with me, is that this is a game that amounts to a pachinko RPG.  I&rsquo;ll start by talking about what I liked about <em>One Tap Quest</em>.  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg/">Next week</a>, I&rsquo;ll get into what I mean by a pachinko RPG.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I come to a new gameplay experience completely naive these days. The only way I feel I can effectively spend my time with a game is typically after having read some sort of guide because my time is extremely limited.</p>

<p>What the <em>One Tap Quest</em> accomplished so well for me was going from barely being able to read the screen to beating the game over the course of 10 minutes.  Admittedly it&rsquo;s a very short and simple game.  But I felt a sense of accomplishment every time my understanding of the mechanics grew.</p>

<p>Oh, these little critters are stronger than these other little critters, better avoid them.  Oh these are power ups, not critters, better aim for them.  With these skills under my belt it only took a little luck to send my character on a march toward victory.</p>

<p>The place where this idea shines is in the power-ups.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ve encountered all of them, but they range from simple buffs that grant free levels to expanding your party into a 3-character-wide enemy-wrecking plow.  For what it&rsquo;s worth, the power-ups were deep enough to keep me interested over 10 minutes of gameplay.  If I were going to engage with this experience over a longer term, I would suggest adding more depth to the power-ups and the enemies, which are as far as I can tell simply harder to kill, and possibly bigger, versions of the puny slimes that move back and forth.  Some of the enemies have variations on the simple random walk style movement of the slimes, but a richer variety of movement and behavior from the enemies would increase the required skill to play the game, and add to replayability.</p>

<p>I think the power-up mechanics add a level of depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a hands-off luck-of-the-draw game.  By aiming for power-ups you have a sense of agency in the action, just like turning the knob controls the velocity at which pachinko balls are launched.  It makes cheering for your lemming-like character(s) more enjoyable: if they could just get a little closer and grab the power-up you aimed at&mdash;no.  Nope, they died.</p>

<p>Go give this great little game a try.  Hopefully it will pique your interest like it piqued mine.  Quirky variations on RPGs seem to be part of the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, with <em><a href="http://www.atlus.com/rollers/">Rollers of the Realm</a></em> and <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> blending pinball and console genre gameplay with the potential synergy <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> never achieved.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-02T12:54:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/02/static-and-dynamic-colliders-in-unity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes">Ray Wenderlich Unity 2D tutorial</a> by <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/clapollo">Christopher LaPollo</a>, Unity&rsquo;s physics engine builds a simulation based on the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html">Colliders</a> present in a scene.  If some those <code>Colliders</code> are declared to be <code>static</code>, then the entire simulation is rebuilt when those colliders move.  Of course, rebuilding a physics simulation when it&rsquo;s unnecessary is inefficient.  By declaring objects to have <code>dynamic</code> <code>Colliders</code>, the physics engine does not have to rebuild the simulation at runtime, that is to say when the game is running.</p>

<p>As with a lot of things in Unity, it is not immediately apparent how you should go about declaring a collider to be <code>static</code> or <code>dynamic</code>.  It would be great if there were just a checkbox in the <code>Collider</code> component.  But there isn&rsquo;t.  It appears that there are some complex things going on under the hood that preclude a simple declaration.</p>

<p>By default a <code>GameObject</code> with a <code>Collider</code> component attached is treated as <code>static</code> by Unity&rsquo;s physics engine.  This would work for a non-moving wall or impassable bit of scenery, but for moving objects like enemies we need to mark them as <code>dynamic</code>.  In order for a <code>GameObject</code>&rsquo;s <code>Collider</code> to qualify as <code>dynamic</code> it requires a <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html"><code>Rigidbody</code> component</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t want the normal features of the <code>Rigidbody</code>, i.e. conferring control of the <code>GameObject</code>&rsquo;s position to the physics system, then you can check the <code>Is Kinematic</code> checkbox.  A kinematic object&rsquo;s position is under the control of the attached scripts, rather than the physics system.</p>

<p>One other trick from the <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes">tutorial</a> is to set the <code>Collider</code> component&rsquo;s <code>isTrigger</code> property to <code>true</code>.  This prevents the <code>Collider</code> from being treated as a solid object in the physics simulation, which could lead to unintended bumping and pushing among various <code>Colliders</code> in a scene.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/involvingsalmon">@InvolvingSalmon</a> points out that the instructions here depend on the version of Unity that you are using.  This article was written for Unity version <code>4.5.2f1</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cinematically inspired <a href="http://tdlk.itch.io/space-is-red">Space Is Red</a> is not so much a game as it is a visual novel.  Out of the games I tried from the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">#spacecowboygamejam</a>, it&rsquo;s one that sticks with me.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On the spectrum of play, these sorts of games are loosely analogous to Choose Your Own Adventure books.  Just as a Choose Your Own Adventure book expects the player to turn to a given page according to the rules laid out at the bottom of the pages to proceed in a consistent, logical fashion, the tropes of a visual novel require the player to interact with the game in order for the story to proceed.  A novel will proceed with the only &lsquo;player&rsquo; interaction consisting of turning to the next page.  I&rsquo;m oversimplifying the difference between <em>real choices</em>, as I would argue, Choose Your Own Adventure Books allow, and <em>mere interactivity</em>, like turning the page of a novel, but you get what I mean.</p>

<p>Visual novels can have real choices and interactivity.  In this case, I&rsquo;d argue that Space Is Red is only interactive.  There are no real choices, short of figuring out the next bit to tap on in order to move the story along.  For me, it&rsquo;s the music that makes the experience gel as something more than an animated e-book.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be presumptuous in my analysis of Space Is Red&rsquo;s gameplay, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I&rsquo;m not interested in arguments about merit simply based on A <strong>is</strong> a game but B <strong>isn&rsquo;t</strong>, so A is better.  I just think it&rsquo;s important to think about these sorts of things when considering the underlying design.</p>

<p>I left the game looping <a href="https://soundcloud.com/postpre">PostPre</a>&rsquo;s driving soundtrack for 15 minutes, even though my first play-through lasted only 2 or 3.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the benefit of interactivity and choices, to extend and prolong the mindshare of some experience or product with the player.  I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that in a cynical way, although the typical model of play can be subverted for more manipulative means (and, of course, it is!).</p>

<p>For me, Space Is Red hit all the right notes and left me with something to think about.  That is what I call a successful gamejam game.  You can see Space Is Red and the other #spacecowboygamejam entries <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">here</a>.

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/06/07/why-you-should-start-simple</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/hobbygamedev">@HobbyGameDev&rsquo;s</a> long-read <a href="http://www.hobbygamedev.com/beg/incremental-learning/">&ldquo;Reasons for Modest First Projects and Incremental Learning&rdquo;</a> tells the tragic tale of overambitious novice developers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In a response to a doubting tweeter, HGD advocates starting modestly to slowly build skills, so that you can tackle more complicated projects later on.  Avoiding overambitious projects that are way outside of your comfort zone is one of the stumbling points for novice and hobby game developers, like myself.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/hammock-driven-creativity/">previous post about Hammock Driven Creativity</a>, I highlighted Rich Hickey&rsquo;s suggestion to keep multiple projects going in order to avoid stagnation.  While I agree with this, it&rsquo;s important to judge the scope of those projects with a critical eye.</p>

<p>Far too often, my ideas start, at least in my mind, with ambitious artwork, animation, and multiple complex combinations of mechanics.  I am neither talented nor skilled enough to pull these projects off.  So it&rsquo;s easy to get stuck.</p>

<p>I often find myself implementing some ad-hoc animation system, spending time reinventing the frame-based or skeletal wheel, as it were.  Animation shouldn&rsquo;t take priority, especially considering that my best artwork is derivative and possibly one step above programmer art.  I should focus on creating compelling prototypes, and worry about polish later.</p>

<p>To build your skillset, HGD suggests starting out by remaking historical games.  By implementing tried-and-true mechanics that are necessarily simple in scope given their ancient hardware, you can confront the problems involved in creating a full game rather than a half-finished proof-of-concept.</p>

<p>By half-finished, I&rsquo;m thinking of a time where I completely abandoned a concept because I was hung-up on optimizing a tile-based room system.  Rather than making the actual gameplay fun and complete, I was focusing all of my time figuring out how to make walls.  Walls are nice in a finished game, and you could make the case that they are required constraints to achieve good gameplay, but they are not where the fun is.  As HGD and my previous post point out, you can keep trying to work on these overly ambitious projects, but your productivity will suffer.</p>

<p>Best to reap the rewards that come from continued productivity and, as HGD says, pick a fight you can win.</p>
