    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently played <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest</a></em>, a game in which you tap to place an RPG character who marches upward, gaining levels by bumping into enemies, to tackle bigger and badder foes.  What&rsquo;s interesting to me, if you&rsquo;ll bear with me, is that this is a game that amounts to a pachinko RPG.  I&rsquo;ll start by talking about what I liked about <em>One Tap Quest</em>.  Next week, I&rsquo;ll get into what I mean by a pachinko RPG.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I come to a new gameplay experience completely naive these days. The only way I feel I can effectively spend my time with a game is typically after having read some sort of guide because my time is extremely limited.</p>

<p>What the <em>One Tap Quest</em> accomplished so well for me was going from barely being able to read the screen to beating the game over the course of 10 minutes.  Admittedly it&rsquo;s a very short and simple game.  But I felt a sense of accomplishment every time my understanding of the mechanics grew.</p>

<p>Oh, these little critters are stronger than these other little critters, better avoid them.  Oh these are power ups, not critters, better aim for them.  With these skills under my belt it only took a little luck to send my character on a march toward victory.</p>

<p>The place where this idea shines is in the power-ups.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ve encountered all of them, but they range from simple buffs that grant free levels to expanding your party into a 3-character-wide enemy-wrecking plow.  For what it&rsquo;s worth, the power-ups were deep enough to keep me interested over 10 minutes of gameplay.  If I were going to engage with this experience over a longer term, I would suggest adding more depth to the power-ups and the enemies, which are as far as I can tell simply harder to kill, and possibly bigger, versions of the puny slimes that move back and forth.  Some of the enemies have variations on the simple random walk style movement of the slimes, but a richer variety of movement and behavior from the enemies would increase the required skill to play the game, and add to replayability.</p>

<p>I think the power-up mechanics add a level of depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a hands-off luck-of-the-draw game.  By aiming for power-ups you have a sense of agency in the action, just like turning the knob controls the velocity at which pachinko balls are launched.  It makes cheering for your lemming-like character(s) more enjoyable: if they could just get a little closer and grab the power-up you aimed at&mdash;no.  Nope, they died.</p>

<p>Go give this great little game a try.  Hopefully it will pique your interest like it piqued mine.  Quirky variations on RPGs seem to be part of the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, with <em><a href="http://www.atlus.com/rollers/">Rollers of the Realm</a></em> and <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> combining pinball and console genre gameplay with the potential synergy <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> never achieved.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/02/static-and-dynamic-colliders-in-unity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes">Ray Wenderlich Unity 2D tutorial</a> by <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/clapollo">Christopher LaPollo</a>, Unity&rsquo;s physics engine builds a simulation based on the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html">Colliders</a> present in a scene.  If some those <code>Colliders</code> are declared to be <code>static</code>, then the entire simulation is rebuilt when those colliders move.  Of course, rebuilding a physics simulation when it&rsquo;s unnecessary is inefficient.  By declaring objects to have <code>dynamic</code> <code>Colliders</code>, the physics engine does not have to rebuild the simulation at runtime, that is to say when the game is running.</p>

<p>As with a lot of things in Unity, it is not immediately apparent how you should go about declaring a collider to be <code>static</code> or <code>dynamic</code>.  It would be great if there were just a checkbox in the <code>Collider</code> component.  But there isn&rsquo;t.  It appears that there are some complex things going on under the hood that preclude a simple declaration.</p>

<p>By default a <code>GameObject</code> with a <code>Collider</code> component attached is treated as <code>static</code> by Unity&rsquo;s physics engine.  This would work for a non-moving wall or impassable bit of scenery, but for moving objects like enemies we need to mark them as <code>dynamic</code>.  In order for a <code>GameObject</code>&rsquo;s <code>Collider</code> to qualify as <code>dynamic</code> it requires a <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html"><code>Rigidbody</code> component</a>.  If you don&rsquo;t want the normal features of the <code>Rigidbody</code>, i.e. conferring control of the <code>GameObject</code>&rsquo;s position to the physics system, then you can check the <code>Is Kinematic</code> checkbox.  A kinematic object&rsquo;s position is under the control of the attached scripts, rather than the physics system.</p>

<p>One other trick from the <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/70344/unity-2d-tutorial-physics-and-screen-sizes">tutorial</a> is to set the <code>Collider</code> component&rsquo;s <code>isTrigger</code> property to <code>true</code>.  This prevents the <code>Collider</code> from being treated as a solid object in the physics simulation, which could lead to unintended bumping and pushing among various <code>Colliders</code> in a scene.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/involvingsalmon">@InvolvingSalmon</a> points out that the instructions here depend on the version of Unity that you are using.  This article was written for Unity version 4.5.2f1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cinematically inspired <a href="http://tdlk.itch.io/space-is-red">Space Is Red</a> is not so much a game as it is a visual novel.  Out of the games I tried from the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">#spacecowboygamejam</a>, it&rsquo;s one that sticks with me.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On the spectrum of play, these sorts of games are loosely analogous to Choose Your Own Adventure books.  Just as a Choose Your Own Adventure book expects the player to turn to a given page according to the rules laid out at the bottom of the pages to proceed in a consistent, logical fashion, the tropes of a visual novel require the player to interact with the game in order for the story to proceed.  A novel will proceed with the only &lsquo;player&rsquo; interaction consisting of turning to the next page.  I&rsquo;m oversimplifying the difference between <em>real choices</em>, as I would argue, Choose Your Own Adventure Books allow, and <em>mere interactivity</em>, like turning the page of a novel, but you get what I mean.</p>

<p>Visual novels can have real choices and interactivity.  In this case, I&rsquo;d argue that Space Is Red is only interactive.  There are no real choices, short of figuring out the next bit to tap on in order to move the story along.  For me, it&rsquo;s the music that makes the experience gel as something more than an animated e-book.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be presumptuous in my analysis of Space Is Red&rsquo;s gameplay, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I&rsquo;m not interested in arguments about merit simply based on A <strong>is</strong> a game but B <strong>isn&rsquo;t</strong>, so A is better.  I just think it&rsquo;s important to think about these sorts of things when considering the underlying design.</p>

<p>I left the game looping <a href="https://soundcloud.com/postpre">PostPre</a>&rsquo;s driving soundtrack for 15 minutes, even though my first play-through lasted only 2 or 3.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the benefit of interactivity and choices, to extend and prolong the mindshare of some experience or product with the player.  I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that in a cynical way, although the typical model of play can be subverted for more manipulative means (and, of course, it is!).</p>

<p>For me, Space Is Red hit all the right notes and left me with something to think about.  That is what I call a successful gamejam game.  You can see Space Is Red and the other #spacecowboygamejam entries <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">here</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/hobbygamedev">@HobbyGameDev&rsquo;s</a> long-read <a href="http://www.hobbygamedev.com/beg/incremental-learning/">&ldquo;Reasons for Modest First Projects and Incremental Learning&rdquo;</a> tells the tragic tale of overambitious novice developers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In a response to a doubting tweeter, HGD advocates starting modestly to slowly build skills, so that you can tackle more complicated projects later on.  Avoiding overambitious projects that are way outside of your comfort zone is one of the stumbling points for novice and hobby game developers, like myself.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/hammock-driven-creativity/">previous post about Hammock Driven Creativity</a>, I highlighted Rich Hickey&rsquo;s suggestion to keep multiple projects going in order to avoid stagnation.  While I agree with this, it&rsquo;s important to judge the scope of those projects with a critical eye.</p>

<p>Far too often, my ideas start, at least in my mind, with ambitious artwork, animation, and multiple complex combinations of mechanics.  I am neither talented nor skilled enough to pull these projects off.  So it&rsquo;s easy to get stuck.</p>

<p>I often find myself implementing some ad-hoc animation system, spending time reinventing the frame-based or skeletal wheel, as it were.  Animation shouldn&rsquo;t take priority, especially considering that my best artwork is derivative and possibly one step above programmer art.  I should focus on creating compelling prototypes, and worry about polish later.</p>

<p>To build your skillset, HGD suggests starting out by remaking historical games.  By implementing tried-and-true mechanics that are necessarily simple in scope given their ancient hardware, you can confront the problems involved in creating a full game rather than a half-finished proof-of-concept.</p>

<p>By half-finished, I&rsquo;m thinking of a time where I completely abandoned a concept because I was hung-up on optimizing a tile-based room system.  Rather than making the actual gameplay fun and complete, I was focusing all of my time figuring out how to make walls.  Walls are nice in a finished game, and you could make the case that they are required constraints to achieve good gameplay, but they are not where the fun is.  As HGD and my previous post point out, you can keep trying to work on these overly ambitious projects, but your productivity will suffer.</p>

<p>Best to reap the rewards that come from continued productivity and, as HGD says, pick a fight you can win.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-19T14:05:03-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/19/styx-ebooks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And now for something completely different: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators">markov chain text generation</a> twitter bot.  Styx_ebooks tweets random text generated from a corpus of Bangsian fantasy novels.  Its name comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrick_Bangs">John Kendrick Bangs</a>&lsquo; novel <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House-Boat_on_the_Styx">A House-boat on the Styx</a></em> and the general <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks">twitter ebooks meme</a>.</p>

<p>I forked it from an earlier project by <a href="https://github.com/jiko">@jiko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jiko/lovecraft_ebooks">lovecraft_ebooks</a>.  There were some minor implementation hurdles, mainly related to Twitter&rsquo;s API and oauth.  Reading the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter">python <code>twitter</code> package</a> <code>twitter.oauth</code> docstring set me straight.  You can check out the code in <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/styx_ebooks">my fork on github</a>.</p>

<p>This sort of text generation algorithm isn&rsquo;t just useful for making annoying twitter bots.  You could alter some of the in-game text or dialog based on a corpus fed into a markov chain text generator. Especially in the case of a Lovecraftian horror game, I can see how this text could serve a thematic purpose in the story.</p>

<p>Say you&rsquo;ve got a Lovecraftian horror game in which the player is an investigator who is trying to figure out what is happening to citizens of Innsmouth.  By interacting with NPCs, the player encounters hand written dialog, with occasional markov-generated gibberish thrown in. The amount of gibberish depends on how corrupted the individual denizens of Innsmouth are becoming.  If the player is not clever enough to determine who is corrupt, the player will be killed.  If the player determines the source of the corruption, the player wins.</p>

<p>Along the same line of reasoning, the concept I&rsquo;m describing here mimics the game <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905">ALZ</a>, a touching short, playable in 2 or 3 minutes, which uses glitchy graphics to convey a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to live with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to the player.  I came across Dylan Carter&rsquo;s ALZ in a <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/making-alz-glitch-fueled-game-alzheimers/">post on the ANIMAL blog</a>.  This approach of literally altering the player&rsquo;s experience of the game world to mimic the subjective experience of characters in the game is ripe for exploration.  I&rsquo;d love to hear about more examples.</p>

<p>You can check out my bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/styx_ebooks">@styx_ebooks</a>, on twitter, happily tweeting the day away.</p>
