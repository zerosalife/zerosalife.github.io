    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I reached out on twitter in a somewhat misguided appeal to #gamedev, asking whether devs consider ethics when designing games.  Apparently there is so much traffic on #gamedev that any tweet will be lost in a deluge of announcements and automated bot retweets.  Oh well, I thought, I&rsquo;ll go it alone.  Given the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/intel-pulls-ads-from-site-after-gamergate-boycott/">recent tone in the communities surrounding games</a>, I feel the need to examine this question: <strong>Do ethics matter in game design?</strong></p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the question of whether game designers should consider the ethical and moral implications of the game, product, or artifact that they are creating.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I should state here that I&rsquo;m not smart enough of or trained well enough to think about these sorts of things.  So I&rsquo;ve appealed to <a href="http://innovate.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Winner-Do-Artifacts-Have-Politics-1980.pdf">an article by Langdon Winner called <em>Do Artifacts Have Politics?</em></a>, which I will summarize here.</p>

<p>My overall thesis is that the things that game designers create carry intentional messages that should reflect the morals and ethics with which the game designers are comfortable.  In other words, I&rsquo;m arguing that game design should be conducted in an ethical manner.  I don&rsquo;t always think that this should necessarily <strong>restrict</strong> design, but I do think this easily neglected aspect of design matters.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear here, art and artifacts that are designed are still art, and I&rsquo;m not advocating for some sort of restriction on artistic ideaspace and expression.  What I am trying to do is increase awareness, without necessarily coming to prescriptive conclusions.</p>

<h2>Do Artifacts Have Politics?</h2>

<p>According to the article &ldquo;there is no idea more provocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities.&rdquo;  The main focus of the article is whether &ldquo;machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture,&rdquo; the <strong>artifacts</strong> in question, should be &ldquo;judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and productivity&hellip;but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority.&rdquo;  Winner deals primarily with the environmental and public health issues from rapid modernization and industrialization in the 20th century, challenging the assumption that development and innovation (especially that of scientific investigation) will drive inexorably toward improved circumstance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not as interested in the focus of the article as I am in the thesis it applies.  I&rsquo;d like to argue, with help from Langdon Winner, that games, objects of art designed by game designers, do embody, and in fact reinforce, specific types of power and authority.  As far as the prescriptive moral obligations I outlined in my earlier thesis statement, we&rsquo;ll have to see about that when we get there.  Offering guidelines may be out of the scope of this blog post.</p>

<p>Before you press the submit button on a hasty naysaying screed, Winner acknowledges, &ldquo;We all know that people have politics, not things.&rdquo;  Although, I would argue that in the age of Citizens United, fewer people would be so quick to judge the contention that constructed objects have politics as mistaken.</p>

<p>Winner highlights an overt case of expressing politics through technological systems in which the master builder of roads in a New York city designed overpasses that were too low to allow public transit buses to pass.  Winner cites evidence from a biography of the designer, indicating that these designs were predicated on &ldquo;social-class bias and racial prejudice.&rdquo;  Here we see an example of a technology that on the surface appears designed, albeit poorly, in a neutral manner.  However, when the underlying motivations are revealed, it becomes clear that the design technological system had an express political purpose and political consequences.</p>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s clear that any technological system can, in Winner&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;be used in ways that enhance the power, authority, and privilege of some over others&rdquo;.  These underlying politics of the system can produce a particular set of consequences without any particular user imposing a set of ideals through the application of the technology.  Winner sums up the need to consider these underlying politics well in the following excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>If our moral and political language for evaluating technology includes
only categories having to do with tools and uses, if it does not
include attention to the meaning of the designs and arrangements of
our artifacts, then we will be blinded to much that is intellectually
and practically crucial.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Consequences of design</h2>

<p>When creating a technological thing, Winner identifies two sets of choices that confront the designer with regard to how the technology &ldquo;can affect the relative distribution of power, authority, and privilege in a community&rdquo;.  First is simply do or don&rsquo;t: will you design the thing or won&rsquo;t you?  Second, how will you design specific aspects of the technology?</p>

<p>Winner highlights specific technologies that arguably may have been better for the social fabric had they not been designed.  It&rsquo;s difficult to support Winner&rsquo;s argument here in a general sense, but I see one important lesson for the designer.  Winner talks about criticisms about designers attempting to design politically just systems as idealistic: &ldquo;Whatever claims one may wish to make on behalf of liberty, justice, or equality can be immediately neutralized when confronted with arguments to the effect: &lsquo;Fine, but that&rsquo;s no way to run a railroad&rsquo; (or a steel mill, or airline, or communications system, and so on).&rdquo;  I&rsquo;ll add here, superfluously, that of course this applies to video games as well.</p>

<h2>Own your art</h2>

<p>Like Winner, I hesitate to draw any hard and fast prescriptive conclusions on what should or shouldn&rsquo;t be designed.  There will always be subjective opinion on the political nature of the things that game designers design.</p>

<p>The important thing is for you as the designer of a thing to be aware of the choices, implicit and explicit, that surround your creation.  That sounds kind of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dxos2MnVxe-c">Frankenstein-ish</a>, doesn&rsquo;t it?  What I mean is, <strong>own your art</strong>.  Design things that you feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>When the designers of <a href="http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-responds-to-assassins-creed-female-character-co-1589413130">a triple-A game</a> say they can&rsquo;t implement a female 3d model for the main character, they avow a political position in the design of their technological thing.  They should own up to the consequences of that design choice, including all of the ethical and political ramifications.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-23T10:48:48-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What would make a pachinko RPG?  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/16/one-tap-quest-a-pachinko-rpg/">Last week</a>, I wrote about how I&rsquo;m sort of enamored with <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest&rsquo;s</a></em> tap-and-let-them-go interaction, which I think mirrors the play-style of pachinko.  In pachinko, you have some control over launching the little metal balls, but once they&rsquo;re in play, they&rsquo;re on their own.  This mechanism stands in contrast to pinball, where you interact with a single or multiple pinballs with the paddles, and cue sports (especially bumper pool), where you launch a billiard ball repeatedly with a cue.</p>

<p>As I said last week, I think the basic gameplay in <em>One Tap Quest</em> is interesting enough for a 10-minute session.  But I&rsquo;d like to take this concept and run with it, if you&rsquo;ll let me.  What follows are some concepts that, I think, extend the <em>One Tap Quest</em> pachinko RPG model.</p>

<h2>Player characters</h2>

<p>As I conceive of it, a pachinko RPG is sort of like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_101">Wonderful 101</a></em>.  A changing stock of characters go up against an overwhelming group of enemies.  Just like pachinko rewards players with more pachinko balls, worth real money, a pachinko RPG would need to reward the player with ever more&mdash;and ever more interesting&mdash;characters to bolster the stock and the player&rsquo;s score.  A given character can gain levels when unleashed on the board, a little more unique than generic pachinko balls.  Perhaps characters added to the stock later in the game come at a higher starting level, sort of like characters recruited in later sections of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_Battle:_The_March_of_the_Black_Queen">Ogre Battle</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>Procedurally generated &ldquo;boards&rdquo; could make a game interesting.  Presenting a variable layout of enemies, terrain, and power-ups can challenge players who are already familiar with the basic gameplay.  I don&rsquo;t think that using roguelike elements, such as varying the effects of power-ups like potions in <em><a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a></em> would work very well.  However, incorporating a quest or narrative adventure framework above the level of boards could be engaging.  Here I&rsquo;m using the word level to refer to a conceptual level of hierarchical relationships, rather than an experience level or a stage in a game.  I&rsquo;m talking about the approach that <em><a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a></em> and the built-in 3DS RPG, <em><a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Find_Mii_%283DS%29">Find Mii</a></em>, take.  Each &ldquo;board&rdquo; is a gameplay experience in itself, and the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; have a larger (in terms of conceptual scope) map that ties them together and gives the player a sense of progression or quest completion.</p>

<p>Obstacles on the &ldquo;boards&rdquo; that impair the movement of either player characters or enemies could add another layer of strategy.  In effect these terrain elements could construct a puzzle that they player has to solve by starting their player character down the correct &ldquo;lane&rdquo;, and being lucky enough to gain the required number of levels to beat the &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This approach to using obstacles to make puzzles would require some clever level design.  A puzzle where there is a single right way to complete it would be boring, once you find it you simply wait until you get the required number of levels through sheer luck&mdash;pointless repetition without interesting choices.  However puzzles where there are (or seem to be) multiple routes to complete the &ldquo;board&rdquo; can be interesting.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>I think it might be cool to maintain control over the character after you launch.  In a sense you would be an invisible hand, maintaining control over the pachinko ball as it rolls through the machine.  This game would be sort of like an inverted bullet-hell shoot &lsquo;em up.  Rather than dodging enemies, you would guide your character toward them.  It is probably worth iterating on this mechanic, because <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> seems to use it with relative success.  But I think maintaining control over the character would block out the cheering-your-character-on-from-the-sidelines aspect that I enjoyed in One Tap Quest, and would like to emulate.</p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>

<p>As I mentioned previously, added depth of enemy behavior and power-ups could prolong the experience.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what this would entail at this point, but I think iterating on the basic concepts laid out in <em>One Tap Quest</em> could lead to some interesting variation.  That sentence pretty much sums up my take on what would make an interesting pachinko RPG.  Thanks for letting me spew some thoughts that are little more than design notes.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-16T10:39:34-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/16/one-tap-quest-a-pachinko-rpg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently played <em><a href="http://shimage.net/one-tap-quest/">One Tap Quest</a></em>, a game in which you tap to place an RPG character who marches upward, gaining levels by bumping into enemies, to tackle bigger and badder foes.  What&rsquo;s interesting to me, if you&rsquo;ll bear with me, is that this is a game that amounts to a pachinko RPG.  I&rsquo;ll start by talking about what I liked about <em>One Tap Quest</em>.  <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/23/designing-a-pachinko-rpg/">Next week</a>, I&rsquo;ll get into what I mean by a pachinko RPG.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I come to a new gameplay experience completely naive these days. The only way I feel I can effectively spend my time with a game is typically after having read some sort of guide because my time is extremely limited.</p>

<p>What the <em>One Tap Quest</em> accomplished so well for me was going from barely being able to read the screen to beating the game over the course of 10 minutes.  Admittedly it&rsquo;s a very short and simple game.  But I felt a sense of accomplishment every time my understanding of the mechanics grew.</p>

<p>Oh, these little critters are stronger than these other little critters, better avoid them.  Oh these are power ups, not critters, better aim for them.  With these skills under my belt it only took a little luck to send my character on a march toward victory.</p>

<p>The place where this idea shines is in the power-ups.  I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ve encountered all of them, but they range from simple buffs that grant free levels to expanding your party into a 3-character-wide enemy-wrecking plow.  For what it&rsquo;s worth, the power-ups were deep enough to keep me interested over 10 minutes of gameplay.  If I were going to engage with this experience over a longer term, I would suggest adding more depth to the power-ups and the enemies, which are as far as I can tell simply harder to kill, and possibly bigger, versions of the puny slimes that move back and forth.  Some of the enemies have variations on the simple random walk style movement of the slimes, but a richer variety of movement and behavior from the enemies would increase the required skill to play the game, and add to replayability.</p>

<p>I think the power-up mechanics add a level of depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a hands-off luck-of-the-draw game.  By aiming for power-ups you have a sense of agency in the action, just like turning the knob controls the velocity at which pachinko balls are launched.  It makes cheering for your lemming-like character(s) more enjoyable: if they could just get a little closer and grab the power-up you aimed at&mdash;no.  Nope, they died.</p>

<p>Go give this great little game a try.  Hopefully it will pique your interest like it piqued mine.  Quirky variations on RPGs seem to be part of the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, with <em><a href="http://www.atlus.com/rollers/">Rollers of the Realm</a></em> and <em><a href="http://zh.monst.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Strike_%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA">Monster Strike</a></em> blending pinball and console genre gameplay with the potential synergy <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> never achieved.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/persistent-data-in-unity/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-09T11:09:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/persistent-data-in-unity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m interested in having some data remain available, even though I&rsquo;m switching Scenes in Unity.  In other words, I want this data to remain persistent.  As you&rsquo;ll see below I was tempted to use <code>PlayerPrefs</code> to store the data, but, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJ6FfcJpbPXE">this Unity Live Training on Data Persistence</a>, <code>PlayerPrefs</code> is not the best way to make data persist over multiple Scenes.  <code>PlayerPrefs</code> is an okay place to store non-critical data, like the audio volume, window size, full-screen state&#x2013;you know preferences.  I&rsquo;ll go ahead and show what I believe to be the correct way to store persistent data before talking about <code>PlayerPrefs</code> later.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Persistent data</h2>

<p>To safely and reliably store persistent data, the Unity tutorials suggest that you need to assign a &ldquo;kinda&rdquo; Singleton design patterny script to an empty <code>GameObject</code> that will persist across Scenes.</p>

<pre><code>using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class GameControl: MonoBehaviour {
  public static GameControl control;

  public float health;
  public float experience;

  void Awake() {
    if(control == null){
      DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
      control = this;
    } else if(control != this) {
      // There can be only one!
      Destroy(gameObject);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>static</code> reference means that we can just access the values in the <code>GameControl</code> script.</p>

<h2>How to access data in the GameController.</h2>

<pre><code>GameController.control.health = 100;
</code></pre>

<h2>Writing persistent data to a binary file</h2>

<p>The persistent data that&rsquo;s under the control of the <code>GameController</code> is perfectly happy hanging out when your application is running.  It will persist between Scenes when other data is wiped out by Unity&rsquo;s garbage collection.  But what if you want to maintain persistent data when the application is closed.</p>

<p>Ah hah!  Finally, an answer to my nagging question about writing persistent data to plain text files, like <code>PlayerPrefs</code> or simply a file in a local directory.  Wouldn&rsquo;t a player be able to modify the data?</p>

<p>Enter the binary format:</p>

<pre><code>// Add two more libraries
using System;
using System.Runtime.Serialzation.Formatters.Binary;
</code></pre>

<p>Where do we save it?  The persistent data path: <code>Application.persistentDataPath</code>.  We&rsquo;ll need one more library to do some input and output to files:</p>

<pre><code>// Requires one more library and we're ready to get cooking with some
// methods
using System.IO;

public void Save() {
  BinaryFormatter bf = new BinaryFormatter();
  FileStream file = File.Open(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat",
                              FileMode.Open);

  PlayerData data = new PlayerData();
  data.experiencePoints = experiencePoints;
  data.playerLevel = playerLevel;

  bf.Serialize(file, data);
  file.Close();
}

public void Load() {
  if(File.Exists(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat")) {
    BinaryFormatter bf = new BinaryFormatter();
    FileStream file = File.Open(Application.persistentDataPath + "/gameInfo.dat",
                                FileMode.Open);
    PlayerData data = (PlayerData)bf.Deserialize(file);
    file.Close();

    experiencePoints = data.experiencePoints;
    playerLevel = data.playerLevel;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to make the <code>PlayerData</code> class that we will tag with <code>[Serializable]</code> so Unity will know that we want to write this to a binary file at some point in the future.  This affects how Unity stores the data internally, but it doesn&rsquo;t really change how we interact with it.</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
class PlayerData {
  // TODO: see about making gets and sets.
  // TODO: automate the generation of this data structure.  See:
  // http://forums.devx.com/showthread.php?170650-How-to-dynamically-add-property-to

  // Add new variables for loading and saving here.
  public int experiencePoints;
  public int playerLevel;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After writing up this article, I came across an older, possibly better article on Unity Gems.  Please check out that write-up and all of the great content on the site.  <a href="http://unitygems.com/saving-data-1-remember-me/">http://unitygems.com/saving-data-1-remember-me/</a></p>

<p>My full <code>GameController</code> data persistence Singleton script is available in <a href="https://gist.github.com/zerosalife/6f6e811b27761d287ea5">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s the best solution I&rsquo;ve found to date for having persistent data across scenes and play sessions.  I&rsquo;ve included my rough first stabs at the problem below.  Keep in mind that anything following this point is just included just to make my notes available, and it&rsquo;s not meant to be a guide.</p>

<h2>Old notes: PlayerPrefs</h2>

<p>In order to have persistent data between Scenes, I was previously going to make use of Unity&rsquo;s <code>PlayerPrefs</code>, a class that implements persistent data storage for <code>ints</code>, <code>floats</code>, and <code>strings</code>.  Notably absent are useful data types like <code>Vector3</code> to maintain, for example, <code>transform</code> data between Scenes.  Some of the solutions I found may still be helpful for more storing complex data types in <code>PlayerPrefs</code>.</p>

<p>One potential solution is to simply set a <code>GameObject</code>&rsquo;s <code>transform.position</code> to some constant <code>Vector3</code> value in the freshly loaded Scene.  While this is possible in some applications, I&rsquo;m going to assume that eventually you&rsquo;ll want to transfer some dynamic position information between Scenes.</p>

<p>Here are two potentially helpful sources to achieve this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theappguruz.com/tutorial/store-vector3-data-easily-using-json-parsing-possible-using-playerprefs/">http://www.theappguruz.com/tutorial/store-vector3-data-easily-using-json-parsing-possible-using-playerprefs/</a>, based on work by Mehta Dakshil.  While JSON parsing looks interesting, it requires an external <code>.dll</code>, <code>JsonFx.Json.dll</code>.  And I&rsquo;m not interested in external dependencies here.  It may work great for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title%3DArrayPrefs">&lt;http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=ArrayPrefs></a>, based on work by Mario Madureiera Fontes and Daniel P. Rossi.  (Note: since <code>GetVector3</code> depends on <code>GetFloatArray</code>, there could be some error due to <code>GetFloatArray</code> casting strings to floats.  But the error introduce in the resulting <code>Vector3</code> is unlikely to be noticeable.)</p>

<p>Actually, see a more updated version here: <a href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/ArrayPrefs2">http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/ArrayPrefs2</a>, which is based on work by Eric Haines.</p>

<p>According to the text, the script should be placed in the <code>Standard Assets</code> directory, so that it can be accessed from both <code>C#</code> and <code>Boo</code> scripts.</p>

<p>To see a faster implementation for mobile devices, where the data to be saved in PlayerPrefs is cached in memory, see: <a href="http://www.previewlabs.com/writing-playerprefs-fast/">http://www.previewlabs.com/writing-playerprefs-fast/</a>.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-26T11:08:44-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/07/26/space-is-read</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cinematically inspired <a href="http://tdlk.itch.io/space-is-red">Space Is Red</a> is not so much a game as it is a visual novel.  Out of the games I tried from the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">#spacecowboygamejam</a>, it&rsquo;s one that sticks with me.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On the spectrum of play, these sorts of games are loosely analogous to Choose Your Own Adventure books.  Just as a Choose Your Own Adventure book expects the player to turn to a given page according to the rules laid out at the bottom of the pages to proceed in a consistent, logical fashion, the tropes of a visual novel require the player to interact with the game in order for the story to proceed.  A novel will proceed with the only &lsquo;player&rsquo; interaction consisting of turning to the next page.  I&rsquo;m oversimplifying the difference between <em>real choices</em>, as I would argue, Choose Your Own Adventure Books allow, and <em>mere interactivity</em>, like turning the page of a novel, but you get what I mean.</p>

<p>Visual novels can have real choices and interactivity.  In this case, I&rsquo;d argue that Space Is Red is only interactive.  There are no real choices, short of figuring out the next bit to tap on in order to move the story along.  For me, it&rsquo;s the music that makes the experience gel as something more than an animated e-book.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be presumptuous in my analysis of Space Is Red&rsquo;s gameplay, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I&rsquo;m not interested in arguments about merit simply based on A <strong>is</strong> a game but B <strong>isn&rsquo;t</strong>, so A is better.  I just think it&rsquo;s important to think about these sorts of things when considering the underlying design.</p>

<p>I left the game looping <a href="https://soundcloud.com/postpre">PostPre</a>&rsquo;s driving soundtrack for 15 minutes, even though my first play-through lasted only 2 or 3.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the benefit of interactivity and choices, to extend and prolong the mindshare of some experience or product with the player.  I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that in a cynical way, although the typical model of play can be subverted for more manipulative means (and, of course, it is!).</p>

<p>For me, Space Is Red hit all the right notes and left me with something to think about.  That is what I call a successful gamejam game.  You can see Space Is Red and the other #spacecowboygamejam entries <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">here</a>.  If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about Space Is Red&rsquo;s creator <a href="http://toddluke.com/">Todd Luke</a>, you can find an interview <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TalhaKaya/20140711/220825/Finding_Beauty_in_Imperfection_Interview_with_Todd_Luke.php">here</a>.</p>
