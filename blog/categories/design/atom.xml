    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/psysal">@psysal</a> posed this question to the game dev community:</p>

<p><div class='embed tweet'>Tweet could not be processed</div></p>

<p>You can see all the responses by following the link to the original tweet.</p>

<p>The consensus is that caves are essential features for games for three reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Linearity</li>
<li>Repeatability of composition</li>
<li>Curiosity</li>
</ol>

<h2>Caves are linear</h2>

<p>In terms of their schematic representation in the design of a game, caves can boil down to one enclosed &lsquo;area&rsquo; or room with a single entrance.  This doesn&rsquo;t account for some of the amazing environments in intricately designed games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid">Super Metroid</a>, recently broken down by <a href="https://twitter.com/gamespite">@gamespite</a> in <a href="http://www.anatomyofgames.com/2013/12/08/the-anatomy-of-super-metroid-01-moving-pictures/">the Anatomy of Games series</a>.</p>

<p>But, at the most basic level, a cave must have a mouth, or an entrance, and at least one room.  This simplifies the representation of the critical path of play, because once the cave has been fully explored there are no possible branches that the player could have taken to leave the cave.  The single entrance is also a single exit.  Even if there are many internal rooms, this representation holds true, as long as there are ultimately no &lsquo;back doors&rsquo; out of the cave.</p>

<p>The designer can rely on the fact that once the player has received any rewards for exploring the cave, the player can reasonably be expected to pop out of the entrance of the cave looking for the next available challenge surmountable with any freshly acquired toys.</p>

<h2>Caves offer repeatable composition</h2>

<p>For whatever atavistic significance they hold in our psyches, caves do not have to rely on realistic representations in game design.  Any old hole in some rock will almost invariably create a believable sense of cave-ness.  Yeah, I said cave-ness. You know cave-ocity, general cave-itude.</p>

<p>Since we don&rsquo;t spend much time in caves, day-to-day, we don&rsquo;t hold them to the same level of fidelity to which we would hold, say, buildings or automobiles.  The same architectural details necessary to represent a house in a video game can be painted in broad strokes to represent a cave.</p>

<p>In tile-based games, this means that a designer can reuse tiles over and over again to craft a general shape without worrying too much about players noticing, or being bothered by, the similarities.  Caves are thus more defined by the space created rather than the graphics used to define them.  This sense of space is what drives the third essential feature of caves in game design, a sense of curiosity, the drive to explore.</p>

<h2>Caves are inherently curious</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I buy the argument that we have some evolutionary instinct that drives us to explore caves, but the fact remains.  Something about caves begs exploration.</p>

<p>Call it the <em>Will to Spelunk</em>.</p>

<p>Once a space has been created, the player wants to explore every nook and cranny for collectible power ups or items.  Certainly the rewards are powerful motivators.  But there is something to the exploration for exploration&rsquo;s sake.  Simply completing one&rsquo;s mental map of the space becomes a goal in itself.</p>

<h2>Coda</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s intriguing that caves are such a fixture in the established vocabulary of game design.  The three features highlighted in this post make it clear that caves remain a useful game design pattern because they serve an essential purpose in the ludic lexicon of games.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/26/clojure-rhizome-labeled-edge-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-26T09:47:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/26/clojure-rhizome-labeled-edge-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/rhizome">Rhizome package</a> for Clojure to rapidly prototype the dependency graph for a crafting system.  It&rsquo;s nice to be able to add and remove components while generating visualizations on-the-fly.  Clojure&rsquo;s simple, composable syntax, aided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6h5dFyyUX0">paredit</a>, makes shuffling around key-value pairs, and even whole dictionaries, quick and easy.</p>

<p>The existing Rhizome documentation shows simple examples for labeling the nodes of a directed graph.  In order to show the relationship between nodes on the graph, I&rsquo;d like to also label the edges, or the arrows connecting the nodes.</p>

<p>Rhizome provides a keyword argument <code>:edge-&gt;descriptor</code> to most of its functions.  Consulting the source code and the tests for the Rhizome package, I learned that the functions expect <code>:edge-&gt;descriptor</code> to be a function accepting two arguments for each edge: <code>src</code>, the source node, and <code>dst</code>, the destination node.  In order to label the edges, the anonymous function I&rsquo;m binding to <code>:edge-&gt;descriptor</code> will return a dictionary containing the key <code>:label</code> and the value for the edge&rsquo;s label.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example using the simple graph from the Rhizome documentation:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clj'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nv">lsquo</span><span class="c1">;rhizome.viz)&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'> <span class="ss">:b</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:c</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="ss">:c</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:a</span><span class="p">]})</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">view-graph</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">keys </span><span class="nv">g</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">g&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/graph-unlabeled-edges.png"></p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll use a dictionary of dictionaries to associate the source and destination nodes with a label for each edge.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/19/styx-ebooks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And now for something completely different: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators">markov chain text generation</a> twitter bot.  Styx_ebooks tweets random text generated from a corpus of Bangsian fantasy novels.  Its name comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrick_Bangs">John Kendrick Bangs</a>&lsquo; novel <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House-Boat_on_the_Styx">A House-boat on the Styx</a></em> and the general <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks">twitter ebooks meme</a>.</p>

<p>I forked it from an earlier project by <a href="https://github.com/jiko">@jiko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jiko/lovecraft_ebooks">lovecraft_ebooks</a>.  There were some minor implementation hurdles, mainly related to Twitter&rsquo;s API and oauth.  Reading the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter">python <code>twitter</code> package</a> <code>twitter.oauth</code> docstring set me straight.  You can check out the code in <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/styx_ebooks">my fork on github</a>.</p>

<p>This sort of text generation algorithm isn&rsquo;t just useful for making annoying twitter bots.  You could alter some of the in-game text or dialog based on a corpus fed into a markov chain text generator. Especially in the case of a Lovecraftian horror game, I can see how this text could serve a thematic purpose in the story.</p>

<p>Say you&rsquo;ve got a Lovecraftian horror game in which the player is an investigator who is trying to figure out what is happening to citizens of Innsmouth.  By interacting with NPCs, the player encounters hand written dialog, with occasional markov-generated gibberish thrown in. The amount of gibberish depends on how corrupted the individual denizens of Innsmouth are becoming.  If the player is not clever enough to determine who is corrupt, the player will be killed.  If the player determines the source of the corruption, the player wins.</p>

<p>Along the same line of reasoning, the concept I&rsquo;m describing here mimics the game <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905">ALZ</a>, a touching short, playable in 2 or 3 minutes, which uses glitchy graphics to convey a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to live with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to the player.  I came across Dylan Carter&rsquo;s ALZ in a <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/making-alz-glitch-fueled-game-alzheimers/">post on the ANIMAL blog</a>.  This approach of literally altering the player&rsquo;s experience of the game world to mimic the subjective experience of characters in the game is ripe for exploration.  I&rsquo;d love to hear about more examples.</p>

<p>You can check out my bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/styx_ebooks">@styx_ebooks</a>, on twitter, happily tweeting the day away.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/12/the-fate-of-adventure-games</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zoyə Street wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/p/3e3c1e20cfd0">summary</a> of an interesting <a href="http://www.omnsh.org/ressources/527/histoire-formelle-du-jeu-daventure-sur-ordinateur-le-cas-de-lamerique-du-nord-de-1976">PhD thesis by Jonathan Lessard</a>.  Lessard examines the history of adventure games, to see whence they&rsquo;ve come and where they&rsquo;ve gone.  Like Street, I think this approach to thinking about video game design and genre provides useful perspective.</p>

<p>Lessard concludes that the adventure game genre didn&rsquo;t vanish, it sublimated into, and was subsumed by, other modern multi-genre games.</p>

<p>For example, consider 3d RPGs incorporating first-person shooter perspective and playstyle.  I could be describing Skyrim or Titanfall, two dramatically different games.</p>

<p>Lessard and Street argue, convincingly, that these sorts of games have all the hallmarks of adventure games, while evolving new forms and structures of play.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Came across a <a href="http://www.egometry.com/gruedorf/a-penny-for-your-thoughts-a-hundred-for-your-life/">nice article</a> on <a href="http://www.egometry.com/">Ben McGraw&rsquo;s blog, Egometry</a>. Using Super Mario Bros. as a model, Ben explains why merely increasing content quantity is less desirable than increasing content substance.  The title of this post is lifted from a quote in his article.</p>

<p>Sometimes exercising a bit of restraint, keeping the focus of your content simple, can still allow for an interesting and engaging player experience.</p>
