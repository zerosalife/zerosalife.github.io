    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some of my thoughts on my favorite entries to <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam">#adventurejam</a> so far.  Voting ends in a little over two weeks.  So, I&rsquo;m not ruling out the possibility of looking at more games.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/ree-s-ruined-earth-courier-service-shipment-delayed/60572">Ree&rsquo;s Ruined Earth Courier Service: Shipment Delayed</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Amazing graphics.</li>
<li>Loving the dialogue.</li>
<li>I played the Unity version.</li>
</ul>


<p>I find the story, characters, and world-building totally compelling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately interacting with the world is proving difficult.  I could use some indication of when I can walk offscreen.  I think that could help with some pathfinding issues.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see more work done on this game, and I&rsquo;d like to see more content in the Ree&rsquo;s universe.</p>

<h2><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/the-endless-night-prelude/58725">The Endless Night</a></h2>

<p>For as much as I wanted to play this game, I couldn&rsquo;t.  The platform restrictions kept me from trying this interesting looking game.  I think the graphics for this game look pretty cool.</p>

<h2><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/speak-of-the-cloud/60613">Speak of the Cloud</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Sound effects do a good job of situating the experience in a world.</li>
<li>Loving the <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> allusions.</li>
<li>Character animations are impressive, and jive well with the cartoon art style.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t play this game as much as I would have liked.  It&rsquo;s compelling, and the art design really sells intriguing, interactive spaces that make up for the ridiculous pixel-hunting puzzle I encountered.</p>

<h2><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/walkman/60724">Walkman</a></h2>

<p>Like the animation and the constraint of linear movement.</p>

<h2><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/cascade/58292">Cascade</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Got chills from this one.</li>
<li>The sparse sound does a great job of communicating atmosphere.</li>
<li>Got the sense that there was more to this game than there actually was (in a good way), I think due to the writing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Nice scoping for a two-week game jam.  I think this is my runner-up, based on the strength of its story.</p>

<h2><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/theropods/58684/">Therapods</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Great art, animation.</li>
<li>Loving the parallax and layering.</li>
<li>Great sound design.</li>
<li>Great overall design, love the inventory and interface.</li>
<li>Great examples of one-screen puzzles.  The puzzles that I&rsquo;ve heard Tim Schafer call donkey and rider puzzles.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Theropods</em> is my favorite game of the jam.  Not only did it scope the game correctly for the development team, it was also playable in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there you have it, go out there and try some of these games.  If you only have time to try one, check out <em><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/theropods/58684/">Theropods</a></em>.  It&rsquo;s groovy.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/04/25/aurion-and-the-aurochs-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Join me as I look back on my <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam">#adventurejam</a> game, <em><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738">Aurion and the Aurochs</a></em>.  You can take a <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738/">look at the game</a> over on <a href="http://gamejolt.com">gamejolt</a> and you can <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion">view the sourcecode here</a>.  You can see all of the entries at <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games">adventurejam&rsquo;s site</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to look at things that worked, things that didn&rsquo;t, and the lessons I&rsquo;ll take with me moving forward.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What Worked?</h2>

<h3>Pre-planning</h3>

<p>I sketched out the plot using <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/">Microscope</a> to define events, locations, and potential actions and routes the player could take through the game.  Microscope&rsquo;s 3"x5" index card format made it easy to move ideas around when they weren&rsquo;t working.  And it made it easy to see the overall flow of the game.</p>

<p>Once I got the plot Microscope&rsquo;d to my liking, I transferred it to the <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion#microscope">project&rsquo;s readme</a>, using checkmarks and crosses to represent the filled and unfilled circles of Microscope.  Please note, that there be spoilers, so <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738/">go play the game</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<p>While I wasn&rsquo;t using the circles in the typical way that Microscope proposes, it did help me visualize the potential routes for &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; alternate endings.</p>

<h3>Twine macros</h3>

<p>I used some <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion#created-using-artisanal-macros-from">Twine macros</a> for the first time in this game.  I can see how they add some impressive functionality to Twine.</p>

<p>I reckon, if I find the right macros, I would save a ton of time implementing functionality that has already been better implemented as drop-in macros.</p>

<h2>What Didn&rsquo;t Work?</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>I set out to create what I thought at the time would be a relatively simple adventure game.  However, I failed to appreciate the combinatorial proliferation of states that blossomed out as I added more and more items and interactions.</p>

<h3>Timeframe and Pacing</h3>

<p>I found the rigid format of the gamejam to be oppressive and stressful.</p>

<h3>Prose</h3>

<p>Because I was so focused on implementing the game I wanted in the time I had, I feel that the initial creative spark that drove me to design <em>Aurion and the Aurochs</em> wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grow into the creative prose flamethrower that I wanted to torch raw palceholder text into a fine <em>crème brûlée</em>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t force that <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/hammock-driven-creativity/">hammock-driven imagination</a>, especially when I feel crunched for time.</p>

<h2>What Will I Improve Next Time?</h2>

<h3>Plotting</h3>

<p>I will definitely continue to use Microscope for brainstorming and outlining plots.  It could be fun to collaborate with multiple people on this process, as Microscope is meant to be a multiplayer experience.</p>

<p>It may be worthwhile to write-up the &ldquo;single-player&rdquo; approach I used for Microscope brainstorming.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also be interested in trying out Tim Schafer&rsquo;s freewriting technique that I came across in the <a href="http://adventure.doublefine.com/">Double Fine Adventure documentaries</a>.  This probably merits its own post in the future.</p>

<h3>Scope and Pacing</h3>

<p>I will think hard about whether I should participate in gamejams with such strict time requirements for submissions.  I refuse to compromise on work and life commitments to participate in what should be a fun, creative hobby.</p>

<p>I feel emotionally and creatively drained from adventurejam, and I&rsquo;d prefer to have steady, fulfilling creative output.</p>

<p>I think the <em>laissez-faire</em> format of <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/01/make-things-that-make-things-number-procjam-2014/">#procjam</a> was healthier.  I should also note that, although I submitted more things to procjam, the scope of each of those projects was much smaller than my project for #adventurejam.</p>

<p>I think I could have compromised on delivering what was a more or less finished game.  I could have submitted a more prototype-y version that I could work on later.  In fact, I may still refine the prose of <em>Aurion and the Aurochs</em> if I feel so inclined in the future.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m happy with the game I was able to deliver in the constraints of the jam.</p>

<h3>Investigate the Twine macro ecosystem</h3>

<p>Maybe in a future post, I&rsquo;ll look into some of the macros out there.  It&rsquo;d be useful to write simple example code too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it.  I have some good perspective going forward.  In the coming weeks, I&rsquo;m going to look at some of my favorite submissions and finalize my votes for the contest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Math Team Hearts is a speedy modification to Hearts that ironically involves less math than the vanilla game.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>From <a href="http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781482217162">Game Design Workshop</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kinojabber">Tracy Fullerton</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One good way to train yourself in the design of game mechanics is to challenge yourself with controlled design exercises in which you take an existing game system, set a new player experience goal, and make changes to the system to meet that goal.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>We needed a game that played quickly, without a defined endpoint (e.g. when one player reaches 100 points in normal <em>Hearts</em>) because this game was played in free time waiting for school to start or waiting for the bus.  There was no time to spend tallying up scores, counting hearts and doing awkward math.</p>

<p>The rules also modify the risk-reward value of shooting the moon to make it more attractive.  We found the game to be more interesting when multiple parties were invested in shooting the moon with less drawback from accumulating hearts.</p>

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<p>The game plays like normal <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts">Hearts</a></em>, except taking <strong>hearts</strong> no longer gives you points.</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking any number of <strong>hearts</strong> without <strong>shooting the moon</strong> gives you 0 points.</li>
<li>Taking no <strong>hearts</strong> in a round gives you 1 point.</li>
<li><strong>Shooting the moon</strong> gives you 2 points.</li>
<li>Taking the <strong>queen of spades</strong> without <strong>shooting the moon</strong> gives you -1 point.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>player</strong> with the most points at the end of play wins.</p>

<p>For more variety, use <strong>dealer</strong>&rsquo;s choice drafting rules.  Each round, the <strong>dealer</strong> decides on how players will pass cards prior to play.
<strong>Players</strong> take turns dealing.</p>

<h2>Tweaks</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m working from memory, so I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve got the point values exactly right.  Perhaps there should be more of a penalty for taking the Queen without shooting the moon.  That would create a more exciting risk-reward trade-off.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/02/28/wuxingrps-elemental-rock-paper-scissors/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-28T08:13:28-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/02/28/wuxingrps-elemental-rock-paper-scissors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/assets/WuXing-screenshot.png"></p>

<p><a href="http://zerosalife.itch.io/wuxingrps">WuXingRPS</a> is a prototype 5-way rock paper scissors game.  The eventual purpose for the prototype is to serve as a minigame to teach elemental interactions in an RPG battle system.</p>

<p>I chose WuXing elements because they provide a nontraditional (in terms of typical RPGs) series of interesting interactions.</p>

<h2>The Five Elements</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/assets/WuXing-interactions.png"></p>

<p>The five elements are Earth (yellow), Metal (silver), Water (black), Wood (green), and Fire (red).  They have two levels of interactions that you can look at anytime by pressing the <code>?</code> button in the bottom right corner.</p>

<p>The <strong>Destruction</strong> interaction, indicated by red arrows, shows that, for example, Metal chops Wood.  So Metal beats Wood.</p>

<p>The <strong>Generation</strong> interaction shows that, for example, Water grows Wood.  So Wood &ldquo;eats&rdquo; Water.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it.  Click those element disks and try to get more points than the computer.</p>

<h2>Surprise: iteration to find mechanics</h2>

<p>In an earlier version of the prototype the player and enemy choices that resulted in a generation relationship interaction led to a draw.  This meant that 3/5 interactions were draws.  The prototype was less exciting than the current version.  This iteration was critical in achieving a sense of fun in this prototype, as well as fleshing out the goals of an eventual RPG battle system using the elemental mechanic.</p>

<p>So making this prototype led to unexpected value.  Let that be a lesson to keep it simple, because <em>sometimes the simple things that are achievable within your current skillset can lead to surprising results</em>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in feedback, so <a href="http://zerosalife.itch.io/wuxingrps">give the game a try</a> and tell me what you think in the comments or on <a href="http://twitter.com/zerosalife">twitter</a>.  If you&rsquo;re an artist interested in gussying up my shameful attempts at UI and UX, please please please reach out to me.  I&rsquo;d love to improve this prototype.</p>
