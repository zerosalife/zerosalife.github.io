    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cinematically inspired <a href="http://tdlk.itch.io/space-is-red">Space Is Red</a> is not so much a game as it is a visual novel.  Out of the games I tried from the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">#spacecowboygamejam</a>, it&rsquo;s one that sticks with me.</p>

<p>On the spectrum of play, these sorts of games are loosely analogous to Choose Your Own Adventure books.  Just as a Choose Your Own Adventure book expects the player to turn to a given page according to the rules laid out at the bottom of the pages to proceed in a consistent, logical fashion, the tropes of a visual novel require the player to interact with the game in order for the story to proceed.  A novel will proceed with the only &lsquo;player&rsquo; interaction consisting of turning to the next page.  I&rsquo;m oversimplifying the difference between <em>real choices</em>, as I would argue, Choose Your Own Adventure Books allow, and <em>mere interactivity</em>, like turning the page of a novel, but you get what I mean.</p>

<p>Visual novels can have real choices and interactivity.  In this case, I&rsquo;d argue that Space Is Red is only interactive.  There are no real choices, short of figuring out the next bit to tap on in order to move the story along.  For me, it&rsquo;s the music that makes the experience gel as something more than an animated e-book.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be presumptuous in my analysis of Space Is Red&rsquo;s gameplay, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I&rsquo;m not interested in arguments about merit simply based on A <strong>is</strong> a game but B <strong>isn&rsquo;t</strong>, so A is better.  I just think it&rsquo;s important to think about these sorts of things when considering the underlying design.</p>

<p>I left the game looping <a href="https://soundcloud.com/postpre">PostPre&rsquo;s</a> driving soundtrack for 15 minutes, even though my first play-through lasted only 2 or 3.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the benefit of interactivity and choices, to extend and prolong the mindshare of some experience or product with the player.  I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that in a cynical way, although the typical model of play can be subverted for more manipulative means (and, of course, it is!).</p>

<p>For me, Space Is Red hit all the right notes and left me with something to think about.  That is what I call a successful gamejam game.  You can see Space Is Red and the other #spacecowboygamejam entries <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">here</a>.

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/04/19/styx-ebooks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And now for something completely different: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators">markov chain text generation</a> twitter bot.  Styx_ebooks tweets random text generated from a corpus of Bangsian fantasy novels.  Its name comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrick_Bangs">John Kendrick Bangs</a>&lsquo; novel <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House-Boat_on_the_Styx">A House-boat on the Styx</a></em> and the general <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse_ebooks">twitter ebooks meme</a>.</p>

<p>I forked it from an earlier project by <a href="https://github.com/jiko">@jiko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jiko/lovecraft_ebooks">lovecraft_ebooks</a>.  There were some minor implementation hurdles, mainly related to Twitter&rsquo;s API and oauth.  Reading the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter">python <code>twitter</code> package</a> <code>twitter.oauth</code> docstring set me straight.  You can check out the code in <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/styx_ebooks">my fork on github</a>.</p>

<p>This sort of text generation algorithm isn&rsquo;t just useful for making annoying twitter bots.  You could alter some of the in-game text or dialog based on a corpus fed into a markov chain text generator. Especially in the case of a Lovecraftian horror game, I can see how this text could serve a thematic purpose in the story.</p>

<p>Say you&rsquo;ve got a Lovecraftian horror game in which the player is an investigator who is trying to figure out what is happening to citizens of Innsmouth.  By interacting with NPCs, the player encounters hand written dialog, with occasional markov-generated gibberish thrown in. The amount of gibberish depends on how corrupted the individual denizens of Innsmouth are becoming.  If the player is not clever enough to determine who is corrupt, the player will be killed.  If the player determines the source of the corruption, the player wins.</p>

<p>Along the same line of reasoning, the concept I&rsquo;m describing here mimics the game <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905">ALZ</a>, a touching short, playable in 2 or 3 minutes, which uses glitchy graphics to convey a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to live with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to the player.  I came across Dylan Carter&rsquo;s ALZ in a <a href="http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/making-alz-glitch-fueled-game-alzheimers/">post on the ANIMAL blog</a>.  This approach of literally altering the player&rsquo;s experience of the game world to mimic the subjective experience of characters in the game is ripe for exploration.  I&rsquo;d love to hear about more examples.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thegia.com/author/avestal/">Andrew Vestal</a> of <a href="http://www.thegia.com/">the GIA</a> wrote a <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> game for <a href="http://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam">#cyberpunkjam</a> called <a href="http://www.thegia.com/avestal/iceicebaby.html">ICE ICE Baby</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s playable in a quick ten minutes.  Parts of the game remind me of the sorts imagination games I would play growing up. This is quite a nice conceit for a text adventure, and it works well here.</p>

<p>I especially like the use of color to mark the transitions between meatspace and cyberspace.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/02/15/bunnies-dont-surf-number-flappyjam</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://raw.github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf/master/screenshot.png">https://raw.github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf/master/screenshot.png</a>"></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a WIP FlappyBird-like game prototype for <a href="http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam">#flappyjam</a>: <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/bunnies-dont-surf">Bunnies Don&rsquo;t Surf</a>. You are an unfortunate rabbit whose warren is being flooded by a passing thunderstorm.  You have to navigate the tunnels of the warren, propelled by the wave of water flooding your home.  There&rsquo;s only one problem: Bunnies Don&rsquo;t Surf.  So you&rsquo;re stuck hopping up and down in a futile attempt to survive.</p>

<p>Bunnies Don&rsquo;t Surf requires <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://pygame.org/news.html">pygame</a> (<a href="http://pygame.org/download.shtml">version 1.9.1</a>) to play.</p>

<p>Tap <code>SPACE</code> to hop. That&rsquo;s about all there is to say about the controls.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you can see, the game is in dire need of art assets, sound assets, and some sort of high score system.  I&rsquo;ll do my best to add these, once time allows. If anyone has feedback or art design ideas, please let me know in the comments section or on Twitter.  I&rsquo;d love to hear it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post updates as the game progresses, and officially submit it to <a href="http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam">#flappyjam</a> if it&rsquo;s done before the jam ends on February 24.</p>
