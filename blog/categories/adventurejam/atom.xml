    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam">#adventurejam</a> started last night.  It lasts two weeks, until April 17.  I&rsquo;ll be covering my participation on here the blog under the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/adventurejam/">adventurejam</a> tag.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to deploy small prototype Twine game to <a href="http://gamejolt.com">Game Jolt</a>.  I made this game a while back.  It&rsquo;s a complete prototype, but it&rsquo;s still got some display flaws.  I&rsquo;m putting it out there in all of its buggy glory.  The game served its purpose of familiarizing me with some of the ins and outs of Twine, as well as the build process I <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/28/building-twine-games-from-the-command-line/">described last week</a>.</p>

<h2><em>The Age of the Flying Boat</em></h2>

<p>I made a small prototype game based off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>&rsquo;s comic that was turned into the movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104652/">Porco Rosso</a></em>.  You must figure out how to fuel-up and start your airplane to respond to a desperate call for help.</p>

<p>You can play it <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/the-age-of-the-flying-boat/58040/">here on Game Jolt</a>.</p>

<h2>Deploying a Twine game to Game Jolt</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it took for me to deploy my first game on Game Jolt.</p>

<h3>Play by the rules</h3>

<p>First, I had to agree to the rules.</p>

<h3>Title, links, and copy</h3>

<p>Next up, I had to enter some information about my game.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail and maturity rating</h3>

<p>Then, I had a couple of necessary things to do: uploading a thumbnail and setting a surprisingly detailed maturity rating for my game.  There were several optional steps that I skipped for this game prototype.</p>

<p>There were a lot of headaches with the &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo;.  It must be 16:9 and it must be at least 588 pixels tall.  Sounds like a full screenshot, to me.  But, this constraint is necessary because Game Jolt uses a bunch of different dimensions to display the thumbnail on the website.</p>

<h3>Game Distribution</h3>

<p>For my next trick, I uploaded a Game Distribution of the HTML persuasion.  I needed to upload a zip file containing my twine-generated <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<h3>Unhiding so people can play your game</h3>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the critical part.  Pay attention.</p>

<p>There were two (2) final steps to make my game available on the site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, I had to unhide my game&rsquo;s profile when I was satisfied with information I entered.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, and most importantly, I had to specifically unhide the <code>html</code> we uploaded as a Game Distribution in the Distributions tab.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Whew!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve followed along this far, we did it!  We uploaded a game to Game Jolt.  It&rsquo;s a surprisingly detailed process, but that amount of detail gives you a lot of tools make your game&rsquo;s presentation shine.</p>

<p>Go check out <em><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/the-age-of-the-flying-boat/58040/">The Age of the Flying Boat</a></em> and let me know what you think in the comments or on <a href="http://twitter.com/zerosalife">twitter</a>.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/21/adventurejam-prep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <strong>two weeks</strong>, April 3 &ndash; April 17, <a href="https://twitter.com/fenderbenter">Cassie Benter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stacydavidson">Stacy Davidson</a> are hosting a game jam focused on creating adventure games called <a href="http://adventurejam.org">#adventurejam</a>.  I share the organizers' love of point-and-click adventure games, and I&rsquo;m totally thrilled to announce my participation.  AdventureJam is a fortnight-long competition to create and adventurous game-ish experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/rules">rules</a> of AdventureJam are more strict than <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/">#procjam</a>, <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/01/make-things-that-make-things-number-procjam-2014/">the jam I participated in last fall</a>.  They require that the work on a game take place over the two weeks of the AdventureJam competition.  I don&rsquo;t expect to have the time to create something that is truly competitive, but I may as well play along.  Like #procjam, I plan on spending the next series of blog posts covering AdventureJam-related content.</p>

<p>So, click every pixel on the screen, grab everything in sight, exhaust every dialog option, and combine items in new and mysterious ways, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdventureJam?src=hash">#adventurejam</a> time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend the rest of this post exploring the options in terms of game engines for creating adventure games.  The website and forums were great resources for constructing this list.  And I suspect that I&rsquo;ll come across some new resources as the jam progresses.</p>

<h2>Engines (Or, A Decidedly Unresearched and Perfunctory List)</h2>

<h3>Graphical</h3>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/">http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/</a></p></li>

</ul>


<h4>Non-windows</h4>

</ul>


<h4>Unity</h4>

</ul>


<h2>The Adventure Jam Forums</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.adventurejam.org/forums/">#adventurejam forums</a> were a great resource for constructing this overview of adventure game engines.  I only expect the information there to grow as the jam progresses.</p>

<h2>My Plan</h2>

<p>Given my workload, familiarity with and access to the tools listed above, and artistic abilities, I&rsquo;m going to go with Twine to get any real progress done in the time constraints.</p>

<p>Like my <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/procjam/">series of posts on #procjam</a>, I&rsquo;ll tag all the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/adventurejam/">posts related to AdventureJam</a> so they&rsquo;re easily accessible.</p>
