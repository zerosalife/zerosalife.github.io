    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Join me as I look back on my <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam">#adventurejam</a> game, <em><a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738">Aurion and the Aurochs</a></em>.  You can take a <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738/">look at the game</a> over on <a href="http://gamejolt.com">gamejolt</a> and you can <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion">view the sourcecode here</a>.  You can see all of the entries at <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/games">adventurejam&rsquo;s site</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to look at things that worked, things that didn&rsquo;t, and the lessons I&rsquo;ll take with me moving forward.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What Worked?</h2>

<h3>Pre-planning</h3>

<p>I sketched out the plot using <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/">Microscope</a> to define events, locations, and potential actions and routes the player could take through the game.  Microscope&rsquo;s 3"x5" index card format made it easy to move ideas around when they weren&rsquo;t working.  And it made it easy to see the overall flow of the game.</p>

<p>Once I got the plot Microscope&rsquo;d to my liking, I transferred it to the <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion#microscope">project&rsquo;s readme</a>, using checkmarks and crosses to represent the filled and unfilled circles of Microscope.  Please note, that there be spoilers, so <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/aurion-and-the-aurochs/60738/">go play the game</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<p>While I wasn&rsquo;t using the circles in the typical way that Microscope proposes, it did help me visualize the potential routes for &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; alternate endings.</p>

<h3>Twine macros</h3>

<p>I used some <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/aurion#created-using-artisanal-macros-from">Twine macros</a> for the first time in this game.  I can see how they add some impressive functionality to Twine.</p>

<p>I reckon, if I find the right macros, I would save a ton of time implementing functionality that has already been better implemented as drop-in macros.</p>

<h2>What Didn&rsquo;t Work?</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>I set out to create what I thought at the time would be a relatively simple adventure game.  However, I failed to appreciate the combinatorial proliferation of states that blossomed out as I added more and more items and interactions.</p>

<h3>Timeframe and Pacing</h3>

<p>I found the rigid format of the gamejam to be oppressive and stressful.</p>

<h3>Prose</h3>

<p>Because I was so focused on implementing the game I wanted in the time I had, I feel that the initial creative spark that drove me to design <em>Aurion and the Aurochs</em> wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grow into the creative prose flamethrower that I wanted to torch raw palceholder text into a fine <em>crème brûlée</em>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t force that <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/hammock-driven-creativity/">hammock-driven imagination</a>, especially when I feel crunched for time.</p>

<h2>What Will I Improve Next Time?</h2>

<h3>Plotting</h3>

<p>I will definitely continue to use Microscope for brainstorming and outlining plots.  It could be fun to collaborate with multiple people on this process, as Microscope is meant to be a multiplayer experience.</p>

<p>It may be worthwhile to write-up the &ldquo;single-player&rdquo; approach I used for Microscope brainstorming.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also be interested in trying out Tim Schafer&rsquo;s freewriting technique that I came across in the <a href="http://adventure.doublefine.com/">Double Fine Adventure documentaries</a>.  This probably merits its own post in the future.</p>

<h3>Scope and Pacing</h3>

<p>I will think hard about whether I should participate in gamejams with such strict time requirements for submissions.  I refuse to compromise on work and life commitments to participate in what should be a fun, creative hobby.</p>

<p>I feel emotionally and creatively drained from adventurejam, and I&rsquo;d prefer to have steady, fulfilling creative output.</p>

<p>I think the <em>laissez-faire</em> format of <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/01/make-things-that-make-things-number-procjam-2014/">#procjam</a> was healthier.  I should also note that, although I submitted more things to procjam, the scope of each of those projects was much smaller than my project for #adventurejam.</p>

<p>I think I could have compromised on delivering what was a more or less finished game.  I could have submitted a more prototype-y version that I could work on later.  In fact, I may still refine the prose of <em>Aurion and the Aurochs</em> if I feel so inclined in the future.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m happy with the game I was able to deliver in the constraints of the jam.</p>

<h3>Investigate the Twine macro ecosystem</h3>

<p>Maybe in a future post, I&rsquo;ll look into some of the macros out there.  It&rsquo;d be useful to write simple example code too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it.  I have some good perspective going forward.  In the coming weeks, I&rsquo;m going to look at some of my favorite submissions and finalize my votes for the contest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Quick update on #adventurejam</h2>

<p>I feel like my game is on track to finish next Friday.  I&rsquo;m happy to say it&rsquo;s feature complete.  I&rsquo;ll spend the next week polishing, various flavors of bughunting (maybe even some bugfishing and bugtrapping), and, most important of all, prosifying.  My goal is to come up with a little game that&rsquo;s compelling to play, rather than just a series of links to click.</p>

<h2>Midwest Gaming Classic</h2>

<p>Instead of a normal blog post, I want to take this time to shout out the <a href="http://twitter.com/MGC_gaming">@MGC_gaming</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mgc_gaming">Midwest Gaming Classic</a>.  I&rsquo;ll be attending today.  So if you&rsquo;re there hit me up <a href="http://twitter.com/zerosalife">@zerosalife</a>.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/04/04/deploying-twine-games-to-game-jolt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam">#adventurejam</a> started last night.  It lasts two weeks, until April 17.  I&rsquo;ll be covering my participation on here the blog under the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/adventurejam/">adventurejam</a> tag.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to deploy small prototype Twine game to <a href="http://gamejolt.com">Game Jolt</a>.  I made this game a while back.  It&rsquo;s a complete prototype, but it&rsquo;s still got some display flaws.  I&rsquo;m putting it out there in all of its buggy glory.  The game served its purpose of familiarizing me with some of the ins and outs of Twine, as well as the build process I <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/28/building-twine-games-from-the-command-line/">described last week</a>.</p>

<h2><em>The Age of the Flying Boat</em></h2>

<p>I made a small prototype game based off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>&rsquo;s comic that was turned into the movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104652/">Porco Rosso</a></em>.  You must figure out how to fuel-up and start your airplane to respond to a desperate call for help.</p>

<p>You can play it <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/the-age-of-the-flying-boat/58040/">here on Game Jolt</a>.</p>

<h2>Deploying a Twine game to Game Jolt</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it took for me to deploy my first game on Game Jolt.</p>

<h3>Play by the rules</h3>

<p>First, I had to agree to the rules.</p>

<h3>Title, links, and copy</h3>

<p>Next up, I had to enter some information about my game.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail and maturity rating</h3>

<p>Then, I had a couple of necessary things to do: uploading a thumbnail and setting a surprisingly detailed maturity rating for my game.  There were several optional steps that I skipped for this game prototype.</p>

<p>There were a lot of headaches with the &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo;.  It must be 16:9 and it must be at least 588 pixels tall.  Sounds like a full screenshot, to me.  But, this constraint is necessary because Game Jolt uses a bunch of different dimensions to display the thumbnail on the website.</p>

<h3>Game Distribution</h3>

<p>For my next trick, I uploaded a Game Distribution of the HTML persuasion.  I needed to upload a zip file containing my twine-generated <code>index.html</code>.</p>

<h3>Unhiding so people can play your game</h3>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the critical part.  Pay attention.</p>

<p>There were two (2) final steps to make my game available on the site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, I had to unhide my game&rsquo;s profile when I was satisfied with information I entered.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, and most importantly, I had to specifically unhide the <code>html</code> we uploaded as a Game Distribution in the Distributions tab.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Whew!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve followed along this far, we did it!  We uploaded a game to Game Jolt.  It&rsquo;s a surprisingly detailed process, but that amount of detail gives you a lot of tools make your game&rsquo;s presentation shine.</p>

<p>Go check out <em><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/adventure/the-age-of-the-flying-boat/58040/">The Age of the Flying Boat</a></em> and let me know what you think in the comments or on <a href="http://twitter.com/zerosalife">twitter</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/21/adventurejam-prep/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-21T09:53:07-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2015/03/21/adventurejam-prep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <strong>two weeks</strong>, April 3 &ndash; April 17, <a href="https://twitter.com/fenderbenter">Cassie Benter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stacydavidson">Stacy Davidson</a> are hosting a game jam focused on creating adventure games called <a href="http://adventurejam.org">#adventurejam</a>.  I share the organizers' love of point-and-click adventure games, and I&rsquo;m totally thrilled to announce my participation.  AdventureJam is a fortnight-long competition to create and adventurous game-ish experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam/rules">rules</a> of AdventureJam are more strict than <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/">#procjam</a>, <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/01/make-things-that-make-things-number-procjam-2014/">the jam I participated in last fall</a>.  They require that the work on a game take place over the two weeks of the AdventureJam competition.  I don&rsquo;t expect to have the time to create something that is truly competitive, but I may as well play along.  Like #procjam, I plan on spending the next series of blog posts covering AdventureJam-related content.</p>

<p>So, click every pixel on the screen, grab everything in sight, exhaust every dialog option, and combine items in new and mysterious ways, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdventureJam?src=hash">#adventurejam</a> time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to spend the rest of this post exploring the options in terms of game engines for creating adventure games.  The website and forums were great resources for constructing this list.  And I suspect that I&rsquo;ll come across some new resources as the jam progresses.</p>

<h2>Engines (Or, A Decidedly Unresearched and Perfunctory List)</h2>

<h3>Graphical</h3>

<h4>Windows</h4>

</ul>


<h2>The Adventure Jam Forums</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.adventurejam.org/forums/">#adventurejam forums</a> were a great resource for constructing this overview of adventure game engines.  I only expect the information there to grow as the jam progresses.</p>

<h2>My Plan</h2>

<p>Given my workload, familiarity with and access to the tools listed above, and artistic abilities, I&rsquo;m going to go with Twine to get any real progress done in the time constraints.</p>

<p>Like my <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/procjam/">series of posts on #procjam</a>, I&rsquo;ll tag all the <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/categories/adventurejam/">posts related to AdventureJam</a> so they&rsquo;re easily accessible.</p>
