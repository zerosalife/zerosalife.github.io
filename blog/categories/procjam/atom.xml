<p><a href="https://itch.io/jam/procjam">#ProcJam 2015</a> started yesterday.  I&rsquo;m working on a mech vehicle generator web app.  You can check it out at <a href="https://mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com/">mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com</a>. The prototype layout and generation code is complete.  What I need now is an artist to replace the placekitten pictures I&rsquo;m currently using.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Roadmap</h2>

<h3>Backend and client code</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on setting up the web app, but the underlying generator code is done.  I&rsquo;ve made it modular, so we can plug in as many or as few art assets as you like</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>Largely cribbed from old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Gear"><em>Heavy Gear</em></a> character sheets.  I&rsquo;m satisfied with it.  But if you have a better design, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>What I&rsquo;m looking for are images of mechs in whatever style you choose that can be broken into individual layers composed of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head</li>
<li>Torso</li>
<li>Shoulders (left &amp; right)</li>
<li>Arms (left &amp; right)</li>
<li><p>Legs</p></li>
<li><p>Weapons</p></li>
</ul>


<p>An example of what I&rsquo;m thinking of here are the mechs from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Mission">Front Mission</a></em> series of games.  Mechs in that series had sprites that were composed of individual parts that composited together based on the customizations that you made to your mechs.  See this <a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/frontmiss/sheet/38202/">example from the original <em>Front Mission</em> on SNES</a>.</p>

<h3>Image layout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write code (likely CSS) that composites your drawings based on the output of the generator to create custom, procedurally generated pictures to go along with each of the mechs.</p>

<h2>What I need from you</h2>

<p>At the most basic level it would be nice to create several &ldquo;families&rdquo; of heads, torsos, shoulders, arms, and legs.  Creating cool weapons that map on to hard points, i.e. a shoulder mounted rocket launcher that could mount on the left shoulder, would be icing on the cake.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to work with an iterative process, if you&rsquo;re cool with that.  If you have rough sketches, pass them along.  They&rsquo;ll help with getting a sense for how to layout the composite images in CSS.  This thing doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, we can continually refine it as we go.</p>

<p>Communication and coordination to make sure I have the latest versions of your art assets.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ll be working on</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be integrating the generator backend with the frontend, laying out any art assets, and extending the generator as time permits.</p>

<h2>What we&rsquo;ll get</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll come out of this with a cool little generator to play with, hopefully creating many hilarious mecha.  Who knows, down the road this could lead to more collaboration between the two of us and/or the generator could serve as a component of a larger mecha game.</p>

<p>In any case, you will get equal billing on the generator itself and all blog posts about the generator.  You will retain all rights to the art you create.  Outside of the generator itself, I would only request to use the art assets in screenshots on the blog and twitter.</p>

<h2>Sound good?</h2>

<p>Sound good?  Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/zerosalife">twitter</a>, I&rsquo;m happy to communicate over DMs, in the comments below, or via email (my twitter handle at gmail)!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>My green fingers sweat on the handle of my pistol as I creep through the door, into the next room.  I found two boxes of ammunition in the previous room so I&rsquo;m well equipped for the next horrible monster I encounter.  My grip on the pistol tightens as a horrible three-legged spherical thing jumps down from the ceiling, pirouetting to land on its feet and shooting a stream of acidic liquid at me.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; is all I manage to get out, as I feel the Burster&rsquo;s fluid eat into my skin.  Without thinking I fire at it, killing the thing in two shots.</em></p>

<p><em>While reloading my pistol, I notice a glowing jewel on the stone.  If it&rsquo;s what the briefings said, this is the teleport stone that will allow me to phase out of our normal reality just long enough to escape the next deadly monster I encounter in</em> DUNGEN [Star].</p>

<p><a href="/images/assets/DUNGENStar.gif"><img class="center" src="/images/assets/DUNGENStar.gif"></a></p>

<p>(Please excuse my lame attempt at illustrating play with a .gif).</p>

<p><a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/procjam-review/">Last week, I posted an overview of my favorite #procjam games</a>.  I felt remissed when I got a tweet from the designer, asking whether I had actually printed and played the game.  I hadn&rsquo;t and neither had any of the other reviewers who praised it.  So, this week I took some time to cut out the cards on my computer, effectively making a print-and-play game I could play in Illustrator without bothering to print it out.</p>

<p>After the initial time investment, <em><a href="http://jctwood.itch.io/dungen">DUNGEN [Star]</a></em>, a print-and-play game designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@JctWood</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/paperjam">#paperjam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/procjam">#procjam</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7dfps">#7dfps</a> gamejams, plays quickly.  Especially if you are brave enough to choose the roguelike secret difficulty level of starting with 1HP.  Add to that, the advanced enemy rules, which give the monsters more personality on top of their already evocative illustrations and you&rsquo;ve got a challenging game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of the cartoonish art style of <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em>.  The character design does a good job of communicating interesting variety, even though there are few monsters to go up against.</p>

<p><em>DUNGEN [Star]</em> runs out of steam quickly, but I think the intent behind it is clear.  This game does a good job of bringing the feel of a procedural first-person shooter with roguelike elements to the print-and-play market.  I think extending the combat to involve multiple weapons would add some depth to the game.  I would like to see more enemies, particularly ones with more interesting advanced enemy rules.  I&rsquo;d also like to see an overarching goal or theme tying together <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em>&rsquo;s dungeoning and star, so you feel more satisfied when you survive the dungeon.  With that criticism said, I still think <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em> succeeds as a gamejam game and a great prototype from which to build.</p>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/procjam-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking through the entries, I could only spend a minute or two with each entry.  It helped if the game ran in my browser, so HTML and Unity were big.  Here are some of the games that caught my eye.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The top two</h2>

<h2>JET/LAG</h2>

<p>Simple instructions: &ldquo;Click to move. Kill enemies by bashing them.&rdquo;  There may be little to <em><a href="http://svblm.itch.io/jet-lag">JET/LAG</a></em>, but its excellent stylish visuals set this entry apart for me.  A CRT-like distortion bends the corners of the screen complete with scrolling scan lines, while multi-colored text oscillates above a simple square.  The simple square is your character battering your way through procedurally generated maze-like levels.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no fancy art in this game, all the characters are made from simple shapes.  But that doesn&rsquo;t stop the graphics from impressing.  It&rsquo;s clear that <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeCataford">@JakeCataford</a> turned the juice up to 11, and it works.  The game feels great.</p>

<p>As a &ldquo;rogue-like like like&rdquo; you may expect it to be deviously hard, and you&rsquo;d be right.  But the controls are responsive and the enemies telegraph their moves, so you feel like you are learning something with each death.  <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeCataford">@JakeCataford</a> clearly understands some fundamentals of engaging game design and I&rsquo;m excited to see what&rsquo;s coming up next.</p>

<h2>DUNGEN [star]</h2>

<p>A multi-jam entry for <a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam">#procjam</a>, <a href="http://itch.io/jam/paper-jam-1">#paperjam</a>, and <a href="http://7dfps.com/">#7dfps</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@jctwood</a>, this first person shooter uses shuffling to generate a dynamic dungeon with each play-through.  I like the simplicity of the mechanics <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@jctwood</a> has designed.  Stats on a 1-10 scale can be just as interesting as stats in the thousands.  There are even multiple skin options for the protagonist&rsquo;s hand.  That&rsquo;s more advanced than all three <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%2528series%2529">DOOM</a></em>s.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m most interested in the literal realization of the procedural generation algorithm.  By shuffling the cards the procedural generation of the dungeon is clear both to designer and player, and this type of randomization has been used for many years in many games with standard and nonstandard sets of cards.  I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how this shuffling mechanic, both literal and metaphorical, can be leveraged to encourage new avenues of play in the future.  I can imagine tuning some aspects of a proc gen algorithm by exposing the contents to the player as a deck of cards, both literally as is typical in CCGs and other tabletop games and as a metaphor for abstraction of systems in a video game.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-15T07:22:18-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/15/patchwerk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Procjam updates</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the week at a couple of major international conferences sponsored to some degree by old dead-tree journals.  I was struck, following last weekends' <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q%3Dprocjam">#procjam</a> <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/procjam">talks</a>, by the lack of openness.  None of these talks are going to be made freely available.  Photography and recording is actively discouraged.  The official conference hashtags, when provided, were silent or only used by those in attendance.  While this exclusivity may generate profits for the aforementioned dead-tree journals and give a leg up to those fortunate enough to be able to attend these conferences, I find it ethically reprehensible in the 21st century, given the tools that we have available.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to once again thank <a href="https://twitter.com/mtrc">@mtrc</a> for hosting <em>and streaming</em> #procjam.  Because conference was made freely available, I was able to interact with the attendees in a way that would be impossible if I was trying to divine through twitter what was going on behind closed doors.  I think this kind of openness can only generate more interest and ideas, regardless of the field of study.</p>

<h2>Patchwerk</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/quil/quil">Quil</a> sketch designed to generate patterns for quilts.  The code is <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/patchwerk">available on github</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/patchwerk/blob/master/patchwerk-example.png"><img class="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zerosalife/patchwerk/master/patchwerk-example.png"></a></p>

<h2>What is Quil?</h2>

<p>Quil is a port of <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> to <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>When I came across some interesting pictures of quilts, I was struck by the regularity of the shapes used to construct them.  A quilt is simply a grid of squares containing some pattern of simple shapes.  I thought it would be interesting to have an algorithm generate the grid (what I guess quilters probably call a pattern), so I set out to build some functions in Quil to draw a few simple shapes that I identified in the squares of the quilts and then to randomly draw them in a grid.</p>

<h2>How to model a quilt</h2>

<p>Using the fundamental assumption I already stated: a quilt is just a grid of squares.  My algorithm defines a <code>grid-width</code> and <code>grid-height</code> along with a <code>square-size</code> in pixels that determine the overall size of the quilt pattern to generate.  This allows you to generate an arbitrary number of quilt squares of a certain size.</p>

<p>Each square contains a subgrid with a defined <code>sub-grid-width</code> and <code>sub-grid-height</code>.  In retrospect, it would probably be better to define one parameter because if the dimensions are not square, everything will be screwed up.</p>

<p>I then define several basic drawing functions to fill the squares of the grid.  The procedural generation&rsquo;s <code>draw</code> algorithm knows about each of the drawing functions, called <code>pattern-funcs</code>, and picks one of the <code>patterns</code> to draw each square of the grid.</p>

<h2>The drawing functions</h2>

<p>The primary elements of the quilt squares that I wanted to replicate were large squares, smaller checkers, triangles, and a mixed pattern of small triangles with a square that I called &ldquo;fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The squares (see the square second left from the top right) and the smaller checkers (see quilt square fourth down from the top left) use the same drawing function.  However, they differ in that they utilize different helper functions return the correctly sized vertices and support multiple calls for the smaller checkers.</p>

<p>The triangles (see square in the top right) use a lookup table, <code>triangle-lookup-table</code>, to store information about the appropriate &ldquo;legs&rdquo; for a triangle with a point in a given corner.  By using a common syntax for the vertices, the <code>draw-triangle</code> algorithm can share the vertex lookup algorithm with the square routines.</p>

<p>Then the culmination of my dastardly plan involves marrying a square from the smaller checker function with flanking triangles, based on the subgrid this time instead of the larger grid.  The result is a pattern that looks like a fish to me (see quilt square in the top left).  Because I built the abstract drawing functions, I simply have to take care of the four directional possibilities and let the drawing functions more fundamental handle the work.</p>

<h2>Future plans: toward Patchwerk 1.0.0</h2>

<p>The project is in need of a major refactoring session, when I can find the time.  I developed it in a single monolithic Clojure file for ease of testing in the REPL.  It will be easier to maintain and understand if I separate out the distinct functionalities into their own namespaces.  The ones that come to mind are <code>patchwerk.grid</code> to handle the generation of the grid, <code>patchwerk.patterns</code> to manage the drawing functions, and <code>patchwerk.util</code> to house the helper functions.  I&rsquo;d also like to make it clear which functions use the <code>quil.core</code> namespace instead of using <code>:refer :all</code>.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-(fun-mode">some interesting new functional middleware for Quil</a>).  It provides a framework for you to separate out the mutable state from your Quil functions so that you avoid side effects and can program pure functions, in Processing&rsquo;s typically imperative syntax.  To get this up and running, I imagine that I will have to represent the pixel grid in the <code>state</code> map.</p>

<p>Eventually, and this is beyond the scope of 1.0.0, I&rsquo;m intrigued by the possibility of <a href="https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/ClojureScript">porting this code over to Clojurescript</a> and creating a web-based version of the application.</p>
