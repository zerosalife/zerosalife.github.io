I made a lot of progress on my mech generator for ProcJam 2015.  It&rsquo;s up on the web at <a href="https://mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com/">mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com</a>.  The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/zerosalife/mech-vehicle-sheet">github</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Clojure and Clojurescript</h2>

<p>I used <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> with <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">Om/React</a> via <a href="https://github.com/levand/quiescent">Quiescent</a> to make development quick and easy.  Refactorings, which I spent the majority of my time on, were a breeze compared to other languages I&rsquo;ve been developing in lately.  While this project doesn&rsquo;t have a fancy UI, choosing React made it straightforward to divide the UI into sensible chunks, which I implemented as components.</p>

<h2>No artist</h2>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t find an artist.  Although, starting to look for an artist the day after ProcJam started was inadvisable.  I think not finding an artist is actually a benefit.</p>

<p>Not finding an artist pushed me to come up with the idea of not just choosing and laying out art assets proceedurally but allso generating the art proceduarlly.  I&rsquo;m thinking of somethign along the lines of what I&rsquo;ve seen @strangethink do.</p>

<p>I want to generate symmetric parts for mechs based on the manufacturer.  Same thing for weapons, in the style of <a href="http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons#Weapon_Components">the Borderlands series</a>.</p>

<p>You can see the beginnings of a template as part of the latest revisions on <a href="https://mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com/">mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Not done yet</h2>

<p>Going to keep developing this project in my spare time, possibly for participation in another gamejam or just for fun.  I&rsquo;ll post updates on the blog when I get major features implemented.</p>

<p>My tentative to-do list is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate images for each mech part</li>
<li>Add similar generation for the weapons</li>
<li>Create different art styles based on manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://itch.io/jam/procjam">#ProcJam 2015</a> started yesterday.  I&rsquo;m working on a mech vehicle generator web app.  You can check it out at <a href="https://mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com/">mech-vehicle-sheet.herokuapp.com</a>. The prototype layout and generation code is complete.  What I need now is an artist to replace the placekitten pictures I&rsquo;m currently using.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Roadmap</h2>

<h3>Backend and client code</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on setting up the web app, but the underlying generator code is done.  I&rsquo;ve made it modular, so we can plug in as many or as few art assets as you like</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>Largely cribbed from old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Gear"><em>Heavy Gear</em></a> character sheets.  I&rsquo;m satisfied with it.  But if you have a better design, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>What I&rsquo;m looking for are images of mechs in whatever style you choose that can be broken into individual layers composed of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Head</li>
<li>Torso</li>
<li>Shoulders (left &amp; right)</li>
<li>Arms (left &amp; right)</li>
<li><p>Legs</p></li>
<li><p>Weapons</p></li>
</ul>


<p>An example of what I&rsquo;m thinking of here are the mechs from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Mission">Front Mission</a></em> series of games.  Mechs in that series had sprites that were composed of individual parts that composited together based on the customizations that you made to your mechs.  See this <a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/frontmiss/sheet/38202/">example from the original <em>Front Mission</em> on SNES</a>.</p>

<h3>Image layout</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write code (likely CSS) that composites your drawings based on the output of the generator to create custom, procedurally generated pictures to go along with each of the mechs.</p>

<h2>What I need from you</h2>

<p>At the most basic level it would be nice to create several &ldquo;families&rdquo; of heads, torsos, shoulders, arms, and legs.  Creating cool weapons that map on to hard points, i.e. a shoulder mounted rocket launcher that could mount on the left shoulder, would be icing on the cake.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to work with an iterative process, if you&rsquo;re cool with that.  If you have rough sketches, pass them along.  They&rsquo;ll help with getting a sense for how to layout the composite images in CSS.  This thing doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, we can continually refine it as we go.</p>

<p>Communication and coordination to make sure I have the latest versions of your art assets.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ll be working on</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be integrating the generator backend with the frontend, laying out any art assets, and extending the generator as time permits.</p>

<h2>What we&rsquo;ll get</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll come out of this with a cool little generator to play with, hopefully creating many hilarious mecha.  Who knows, down the road this could lead to more collaboration between the two of us and/or the generator could serve as a component of a larger mecha game.</p>

<p>In any case, you will get equal billing on the generator itself and all blog posts about the generator.  You will retain all rights to the art you create.  Outside of the generator itself, I would only request to use the art assets in screenshots on the blog and twitter.</p>

<h2>Sound good?</h2>

<p>Sound good?  Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/zerosalife">twitter</a>, I&rsquo;m happy to communicate over DMs, in the comments below, or via email (my twitter handle at gmail)!</p>

    <link href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/a-proper-review-of-dungen-star/"/>

    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/a-proper-review-of-dungen-star</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>My green fingers sweat on the handle of my pistol as I creep through the door, into the next room.  I found two boxes of ammunition in the previous room so I&rsquo;m well equipped for the next horrible monster I encounter.  My grip on the pistol tightens as a horrible three-legged spherical thing jumps down from the ceiling, pirouetting to land on its feet and shooting a stream of acidic liquid at me.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; is all I manage to get out, as I feel the Burster&rsquo;s fluid eat into my skin.  Without thinking I fire at it, killing the thing in two shots.</em></p>

<p><em>While reloading my pistol, I notice a glowing jewel on the stone.  If it&rsquo;s what the briefings said, this is the teleport stone that will allow me to phase out of our normal reality just long enough to escape the next deadly monster I encounter in</em> DUNGEN [Star].</p>

<p><a href="/images/assets/DUNGENStar.gif"><img class="center" src="/images/assets/DUNGENStar.gif"></a></p>

<p>(Please excuse my lame attempt at illustrating play with a .gif).</p>

<p><a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/procjam-review/">Last week, I posted an overview of my favorite #procjam games</a>.  I felt remissed when I got a tweet from the designer, asking whether I had actually printed and played the game.  I hadn&rsquo;t and neither had any of the other reviewers who praised it.  So, this week I took some time to cut out the cards on my computer, effectively making a print-and-play game I could play in Illustrator without bothering to print it out.</p>

<p>After the initial time investment, <em><a href="http://jctwood.itch.io/dungen">DUNGEN [Star]</a></em>, a print-and-play game designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@JctWood</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/paperjam">#paperjam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/procjam">#procjam</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7dfps">#7dfps</a> gamejams, plays quickly.  Especially if you are brave enough to choose the roguelike secret difficulty level of starting with 1HP.  Add to that, the advanced enemy rules, which give the monsters more personality on top of their already evocative illustrations and you&rsquo;ve got a challenging game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of the cartoonish art style of <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em>.  The character design does a good job of communicating interesting variety, even though there are few monsters to go up against.</p>

<p><em>DUNGEN [Star]</em> runs out of steam quickly, but I think the intent behind it is clear.  This game does a good job of bringing the feel of a procedural first-person shooter with roguelike elements to the print-and-play market.  I think extending the combat to involve multiple weapons would add some depth to the game.  I would like to see more enemies, particularly ones with more interesting advanced enemy rules.  I&rsquo;d also like to see an overarching goal or theme tying together <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em>&rsquo;s dungeoning and star, so you feel more satisfied when you survive the dungeon.  With that criticism said, I still think <em>DUNGEN [Star]</em> succeeds as a gamejam game and a great prototype from which to build.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-29T09:33:47-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/procjam-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking through the entries, I could only spend a minute or two with each entry.  It helped if the game ran in my browser, so HTML and Unity were big.  Here are some of the games that caught my eye.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The top two</h2>

<h2>JET/LAG</h2>

<p>Simple instructions: &ldquo;Click to move. Kill enemies by bashing them.&rdquo;  There may be little to <em><a href="http://svblm.itch.io/jet-lag">JET/LAG</a></em>, but its excellent stylish visuals set this entry apart for me.  A CRT-like distortion bends the corners of the screen complete with scrolling scan lines, while multi-colored text oscillates above a simple square.  The simple square is your character battering your way through procedurally generated maze-like levels.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no fancy art in this game, all the characters are made from simple shapes.  But that doesn&rsquo;t stop the graphics from impressing.  It&rsquo;s clear that <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeCataford">@JakeCataford</a> turned the juice up to 11, and it works.  The game feels great.</p>

<p>As a &ldquo;rogue-like like like&rdquo; you may expect it to be deviously hard, and you&rsquo;d be right.  But the controls are responsive and the enemies telegraph their moves, so you feel like you are learning something with each death.  <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeCataford">@JakeCataford</a> clearly understands some fundamentals of engaging game design and I&rsquo;m excited to see what&rsquo;s coming up next.</p>

<h2>DUNGEN [star]</h2>

<p>A multi-jam entry for <a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam">#procjam</a>, <a href="http://itch.io/jam/paper-jam-1">#paperjam</a>, and <a href="http://7dfps.com/">#7dfps</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@jctwood</a>, this first person shooter uses shuffling to generate a dynamic dungeon with each play-through.  I like the simplicity of the mechanics <a href="https://twitter.com/JctWood">@jctwood</a> has designed.  Stats on a 1-10 scale can be just as interesting as stats in the thousands.  There are even multiple skin options for the protagonist&rsquo;s hand.  That&rsquo;s more advanced than all three <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%2528series%2529">DOOM</a></em>s.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m most interested in the literal realization of the procedural generation algorithm.  By shuffling the cards the procedural generation of the dungeon is clear both to designer and player, and this type of randomization has been used for many years in many games with standard and nonstandard sets of cards.  I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how this shuffling mechanic, both literal and metaphorical, can be leveraged to encourage new avenues of play in the future.  I can imagine tuning some aspects of a proc gen algorithm by exposing the contents to the player as a deck of cards, both literally as is typical in CCGs and other tabletop games and as a metaphor for abstraction of systems in a video game.</p>
