    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that I&rsquo;m going to participate in the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/procjam">upcoming procedural game jam called #procjam</a>.  #procjam is a global game jam and a live-streamed conference in London focused on making things that make things. You can keep up to date by following the jam tumblr <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/">procjam.tumblr.com</a>. There&rsquo;s already a <a href="http://procjam.tumblr.com/post/99689402659/procedural-generation-tutorials-getting-started">handy list of procedural generation tutorials available on the tumblug</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to submitting one or two projects I&rsquo;ve been working on, I&rsquo;d like to cover the content of the talks with perspective and reactions, and to check out the contest entries after it&rsquo;s finished <a href="http://zerosalife.github.io/blog/2014/07/26/space-is-read/">like I did for <em>Space Is Red</em> from #spacecowboyjam</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say this will be a month-long endeavor, what with my weekly (ish) blogging schedule.  With one or two posts focused on submissions, I think four blog posts may be conservative, so I&rsquo;ll keep writing as long as I&rsquo;m interested.</p>

<p>To make it easier to follow along, I&rsquo;ll tag up all the posts with the procjam category and I&rsquo;ll try to do the same for the tweet announcements, even if it&rsquo;s out of style because the jam was weeks ago.  That&rsquo;s how committed I am to making this happen.</p>

<p>If you get the sense that I&rsquo;m trying to psych myself up for this, I am.</p>

<p>The next couple of months will be very busy in my life.  I&rsquo;ll be traveling and attending conferences, activities that have traditionally consumed my precious blogging time like so many Frito pies.</p>

<p>I may be setting the bar high, but if anything the purpose for aiming high is success.  All too often I hear about jams in the middle when everyone is tweeting out cool prototypes and in the thick of design, or I&rsquo;ll hear about a jam when the contest is long over because someone pointed out that the winning entry was amazing.  Through dumb luck and exquisite taste in following <a href="https://twitter.com/mtrc">@mtrc on twitter</a>, I heard about this gamejam with enough lead time to mark it on my calendar.</p>

<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t produce anything interesting or important, by gum, I&rsquo;m going to participate in and cover this gamejam.  I&rsquo;m not going to let another really cool gamejam slip under the radar.</p>
